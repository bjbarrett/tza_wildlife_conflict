abstract = {Crop monitoring information is essential for food security and to improve our understanding of the role of agriculture on climate change, among others. Remotely sensing optical and radar data can help to map crop types and to estimate biophysical parameters, especially with the availability of an unprecedented amount of free Sentinel data within the Copernicus programme. These datasets, whose continuity is guaranteed up to decades, offer a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically every 5 to 10 days. Before developing operational monitoring methods, it is important to understand the temporal variations of the remote sensing signal of different crop types in a given region. In this study, we analyse the temporal trajectory of remote sensing data for a variety of winter and summer crops that are widely cultivated in the world (wheat, rapeseed, maize, soybean and sunflower). The test region is in southwest France, where Sentinel-1 data have been acquired since 2014. Because Sentinel-2 data were not available for this study, optical satellites similar to Sentinel-2 are used, mainly to derive NDVI, for a comparison between the temporal behaviors with radar data. The SAR backscatter and NDVI temporal profiles of fields with varied management practices and environmental conditions are interpreted physically. Key findings from this analysis, leading to possible applications of Sentinel-1 data, with or without the conjunction of Sentinel-2, are then described. This study points out the interest of SAR data and particularly the VH/VV ratio, which is poorly documented in previous studies.},

Moreover, various land-use/land-cover classes are ultimately resolved, and as yet, crop-specific classifications (e.g. soy-corn vs. soy-cotton double crop) have not been reported in the literature, favoring instead generalized classes such as single vs. double crop. The objective of this study is to present a rigorous multiyear evaluation of the applicability of time-series MODIS 250-m VI data for crop classification in Mato Grosso, Brazil. This study shows progress toward more refined crop-specific classification, but some grouping of crop classes remains necessary. It employs a farm field polygon-based ground reference dataset that is unprecedented in spatial and temporal coverage for the state, consisting of 2003 annual field site samples representing 415 unique field sites and five crop years (2005-2009). This allows for creation of a dataset containing "best-case" or "pure" pixels, which we used to test class separability in a multiyear cross validation framework applied to boosted decision tree classifiers trained on MODIS data subjected to different pre-processing treatments. Reflecting the agricultural landscape of Mato Grosso as a whole, cropping practices represented in the ground reference dataset largely involved soybeans, and soy-based classes (primarily double crop 'soy-commercial' and single crop 'soy-cover') dominated the analysis along with cotton and pasture. With respect to the MODIS data treatments, the best results were obtained using date-of-acquisition interpolation of the 16-day composite VI time series and outlier point screening, for which five-year out-of-sample accuracies were consistently near or above 80{\%} and Kappa values were above 0.60. It is evident that while much additional research is required to fully and reliably differentiate more specific crop classes, particular groupings of cropping strategies are separable and useful for a number of applications, including studies of agricultural intensification and extensification in this region of the world. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Many investigators need and use global land cover maps for a wide variety of purposes. Ironically, after many years of very limited availability, there are now multiple global land cover maps and it is not readily apparent (1) which is most useful for particular applications or (2) how to combine the different maps to provide an improved dataset. The existing global land cover maps at 1 km spatial resolution have arisen from different initiatives and are based on different remote sensing data and employed different methodologies. Perhaps more significantly, they have different legends. As a result, comparison of the different land cover maps is difficult and information about their relative utility is limited. In an attempt to compare the datasets and assess their strengths and weaknesses we harmonized the thematic legends of four available coarse-resolution global land cover maps (IGBP DISCover, UMD, MODIS 1-km, and GLC2000) using the LCCS-based land cover legend translation protocols. Analysis of the agreement among the global land cover maps and existing validation information highlights general patterns of agreement, inconsistencies and uncertainties. The thematic classes of Evergreen broadleaf trees, Snow and Ice, and Barren show high producer and user accuracy and good agreement among the datasets, while classes of mixed tree types show high commission errors. Overall, the results show a limited ability of the four global products to discriminate mixed classes characterized by a mosaic of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation. There is a strong relationship between class accuracy, spatial agreement among the datasets, and the heterogeneity of landscapes. Suggestions for future mapping projects include careful definition of mixed unit classes, and improvement in mapping heterogeneous landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). The identification and mapping of crops are important for estimating potential harvest as well as for agricultural field management. Optical remote sensing is one of the most attractive options because it offers vegetation indices and some data have been distributed free of charge. Especially, Sentinel-2A, which is equipped with a multispectral sensor (MSI) with blue, green, red, and near-infrared-1 bands at 10 m; red edge 1 to 3, near-infrared-2, and shortwave infrared 1 and 2 at 20 m; and 3 atmospheric bands (band 1, band 9, and band 10) at 60 m, offer some vegetation indices calculated to assess vegetation status. However, sufficient consideration has not been given to the potential of vegetation indices calculated from MSI data. Thus, 82 published indices were calculated and their importance were evaluated for classifying crop types. The two most common classification algorithms, random forests (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), were applied to conduct cropland classification from MSI data. Additionally, super learning was applied for more improvement, achieving overall accuracies of 90.2{\%} to 92.2{\%}. Of the two algorithms applied (RF and SVM), the accuracy of SVM was superior and 89.3{\%} to 92.0{\%} of overall accuracies were confirmed. Furthermore, stacking contributed to higher overall accuracies (90.2{\%} to 92.2{\%}), and significant differences were confirmed with the results of SVM and RF. Our results showed that vegetation indices had the greatest contributions in identifying specific crop types.},

The ratios of reflectances in the near infra-red range of the spectrum (about 750 nm) to that of 700 R NIR /R 550 and R NIR /R 550 were directly proportional to the leaves' chlorophyll concentration.

Here we propose a methodological approach to fuse information from the new European Space Agency Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery for accurate land cover mapping of a portion of the Lower Magdalena region, Colombia. Data pre-processing was carried out using the European Space Agency's Sentinel Application Platform and the SEN2COR toolboxes. LCLU classification was performed following an object-based and spectral classification approach, exploiting also vegetation indices. A comparison of classification performance using three commonly used classification algorithms was performed. The radar and visible-near infrared integrated dataset classified with a Support Vector Machine algorithm produce the most accurate LCLU map, showing an overall classification accuracy of 88.75{\%}, and a Kappa coefficient of 0.86. The proposed mapping approach has the main advantages of combining the all-weather capability of the radar sensor, spectrally rich information in the visible-near infrared spectrum, with the short revisit period of both satellites. The mapping results represent an important step toward future tasks of aboveground biomass and carbon estimation in the region.},

This field of study is rapidly increasing due to the benefits and advantages for farm resources management, particularly for studying crop health. This paper reports some experiences related to the analysis of cultivations (vineyards and tomatoes) with Tetracam multispectral data. The Tetracam camera was mounted on a multi-rotor hexacopter. The multispectral data were processed with a photogrammetric pipeline to create triband orthoimages of the surveyed sites. Those orthoimages were employed to extract some Vegetation Indices (VI) such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), examining the vegetation vigor for each crop. The paper demonstrates the great potential of high-resolution UAV data and photogrammetric techniques applied in the agriculture framework to collect multispectral images andevaluate different VI, suggesting that these instruments represent a fast, reliable, and cost-effective resource in crop assessment for precision farming applications.},

abstract = {Two methods for estimating the yield of different crops in Hungary from satellite remote sensing data are presented. The steps of preprocessing the remote sensing data (for geometric, radiometric, atmospheric and cloud scattering correction) are described. In the first method developed for field level estimation, reference crop fields were selected by using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data for classification. A new vegetation index (General Yield Unified Reference Index (GYURI)) was deduced using a fitted double-Gaussian curve to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data during the vegetation period. The correlation betwecn GYURI and the field level yield data for corn for three years was R2 = 0.75. The county-average yield data showed higher correlation (R2 = 0.93). A significant distortion from the model gave information of the possible stress of the field. The second method presented uses only NOAA AVHRR and officially reported county-level yield data. The county-level yield data and the deduced vegetation index, GYURRI, were investigated for eight different crops for eight years. The obtained correlation was high (R2 = 84.6 87.2). The developed robust method proved to be stable and accurate for operational use for county-, region- and country-level yield estimation. The method is simple and inexpensive for application in developing countries, too. {\textcopyright} 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.},

Optical imagery can provide invaluable insights into crop growth and development but is severely hampered by cloud cover. This case study in the Flevopolder illustrates the potential value of Sentinel-1 for monitoring five key crops in The Netherlands, namely sugar beet, potato, maize, wheat and English rye grass. Time series of radar backscatter from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 Mission are analyzed and compared to ground measurements including phenological stage and height. Temporal variations in backscatter data reflect changes in water content and structure associated with phenological development. Emergence and closure dates are estimated from the backscatter time series and validated against a photo archive. Coherence data are compared to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and ground data, illustrating that the sudden increase in coherence is a useful indicator of harvest. The results presented here demonstrate that Sentinel-1 data have significant potential value to monitor growth and development of key Dutch crops. Furthermore, the guaranteed availability of Sentinel-1 imagery in clouded conditions ensures the reliability of data to meet the monitoring needs of farmers, food producers and regulatory bodies.},

abstract = {Grain-yield prediction using remotely sensed data have been intensively studied in wheat and maize, but such information is limited in rice, barley, oats and soybeans. The present study proposes a new framework for rice-yield prediction, which eliminates the influence of the technology development, fertilizer application, and management improvement and can be used for the development and implementation of provincial rice-yield predictions. The technique requires the collection of remotely sensed data over an adequate time frame and a corresponding record of the region's crop yields. Longer normalized-difference-vegetation-index (NDVI) time series are preferable to shorter ones for the purposes of rice-yield prediction because the well-contrasted seasons in a longer time series provide the opportunity to build regression models with a wide application range. A regression analysis of the yield versus the year indicated an annual gain in the rice yield of 50 to 128 kg ha-1. Stepwise regression models for the remotely sensed rice-yield predictions have been developed for five typical rice-growing provinces in China. The prediction models for the remotely sensed rice yield indicated that the influences of the NDVIs on the rice yield were always positive. The association between the predicted and observed rice yields was highly significant without obvious outliers from 1982 to 2004. Independent validation found that the overall relative error is approximately 5.82{\%}, and a majority of the relative errors were less than 5{\%} in 2005 and 2006, depending on the study area. The proposed models can be used in an operational context to predict rice yields at the provincial level in China. The methodologies described in the present paper can be applied to any crop for which a sufficient time series of NDVI data and the corresponding historical yield information are available, as long as the historical yield increases significantly. {\textcopyright} 2013 Huang et al.},

abstract = {Rainfed agriculture output is constantly at risk of being influenced by rainfall deficits and drought events. The northern part of Ethiopia, has witnessed historical meteorological and agricultural drought events, which have highly impacted on smallholders' crop yield. With the frequency and severity of drought events expected to increase in the future due to predicted climatic changes, the need for risk-reduction mechanisms is overt. Crop insurance is an innovative risk management mechanism during extreme weather events like droughts, with index-based insurance designs being more popular and feasible in developing countries where traditional crop insurance is unattainable. This study therefore utilized crop yield data from survey of 34 randomly selected farmers' plots to develop payout thresholds related to reported crop losses during historical drought years to develop a crop insurance index to be triggered by drought. The kiremt (summer) DevNDVI shows the closest proxy to crop losses recorded in the area with a lower threshold of 1.31Qt/ha. The indexes designed by this study performed very well when payout conditions were evaluated in the light of the recent drought years in the area. We therefore advocate the consideration of area-specific crop insurance index for implementation in Ethiopia at large, being more compensatory than the current policies based on weather derivatives.},

abstract = {The use of earth observation data for crop mapping and monitoring in West Africa has concentrated on rainfed systems due to its pre-dominance in the sub-region. However, irrigated systems, though of limited extent, provide critical livelihood support to many. Accurate statistics on irrigated crops are, thus, needed for effective management and decision making. This study explored the use of Sentinel 1 (S-1) and Sentinel 2 (S-2) data to map the extent and yield of irrigated crops in an informal irrigation scheme in Burkina Faso. Random Forest classification and regression were used together with an extensive field data comprising 842 polygons. Four irrigated crops (tomoto, onion, green bean and other) were classified while the yield of tomatoes was modelled through regression analysis. Apart from spectral bands, derivatives (e.g. biophysical parameters and vegetation indices) from S-2 were used. Different data configuration of S-1, S-2 and their derivatives were tested to ascertain optimal temporal windows for accurate irrigated crop mapping and yield estimation. Results of the crop classification revealed a greater overall accuracy (76.3{\%}) for S-2 compared to S-1 (69.4{\%}), with S-2 biophysical parameters (especially the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation i.e fAPAR) being prominent. For yield prediction, however, S-1 VV polarization came up as the most prominent predictor in the regression analysis ((Formula presented.) = 0.63), while the addition of S-2 fAPAR marginally improved the fit ((Formula presented.) = 0.64). Tomato yield in the study area was found to range from 1 to 16 kg m−2, although about 83{\%} of the area have yields of less than 10 kg m−2. Our study revealed that early season images (acquired in December) perform better in classifying irrigated crop compared to mid or late season. On the other hand, the use of early to mid-season (December to February) images for yield modelling produced reasonable prediction accuracy. This indicates the possibility of using S-1 and S-2 data to predict crop yield prior to harvest season for efficient planning and food security attainment.},

abstract = {High-throughput, non-invasive phenotyping is promising for evaluating crop nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) and grain yield (GY) formation under field conditions, but its application for genotypes differing in morphology and phenology is still rarely addressed. This study therefore evaluates the spectral estimation of various dry matter (DM) and N traits, related to GY and grain N uptake (Nup) in high-yielding winter wheat breeding lines. From 2015 to 2017, hyperspectral canopy measurements were acquired on 26 measurement dates during vegetative and reproductive growth, and 48 vegetation indices from the visible (VIS), red edge (RE) and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum were tested in linear regression for assessing the influence of measurement stage and index selection. For most traits including GY and grain Nup, measurements at milk ripeness were the most reliable. Coefficients of determination (R²) were generally higher for traits related to maturity than for those related to anthesis canopy status. For GY (R² = 0.26–0.51 in the three years, p {\textless} 0.001), and most DM traits, indices related to the water absorption band at 970 nm provided better relationships than the NIR/VIS indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the VIS indices. In addition, most indices including RE bands, notably NIR/RE combinations, ranked above the NIR/VIS group. Due to index saturation, the index differentiation was most apparent in the highest-yielding year. For grain Nup and total Nup, the RE/VIS index MSR{\_}705{\_}445 and the simple ratio R780{\_}R740 ranked highest, followed by other RE indices. Among the vegetative organs, R² values were mostly highest and lowest for leaf and spike traits, respectively. For each trait, index and partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were validated across years at milk ripeness, confirming the suitability of optimized index selection. PLSR improved the prediction errors of some traits but not consistently the R² values. The results suggest the use of sensor-based phenotyping as a useful support tool for screening of yield potential and NUE and for identifying contributing plant traits—which, due to their expensive and cumbersome destructive determination are otherwise not readily available.

abstract = {Many crop yield estimation techniques are being used, however the most effective one is based on using geospatial data and technologies such as remote sensing. However, the remote sensing data which are needed to estimate crop yield are insufficient most of the time due to many problems such as climate conditions ({\%} of clouds), and low temporal resolution. There have been many attempts to solve the lack of data problem using very high temporal and very low spatial resolution images such as Modis. Although this type of image can compensate for the lack of data due to climate problems, they are only suitable for very large homogeneous crop fields. To compensate for the lack of high spatial resolution remote sensing images due to climate conditions, a new optimization model was created. Crop yield estimation is improved and its precision is increased based on the new model that includes the use of the energy balance equation. To verify the results of the crop yield estimation based on the new model, information from local farmers about their potato crop yields for the same year were collected. The comparison between the estimated crop yields and the actual production indifferent fields proves the efficiency of the new optimization model.},

abstract = {Understanding the determinants of agricultural productivity requires accurate measurement of crop output and yield. In smallholder production systems across low- and middle-income countries, crop yields have traditionally been assessed based on farmer-reported production and land areas in household/farm surveys, occasionally by objective crop cuts for a sub-section of a farmer's plot, and rarely using full-plot harvests. In parallel, satellite data continue to improve in terms of spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution needed to discern performance on smallholder plots. This study evaluates ground- and satellite-based approaches to estimating crop yields and yield responsiveness to inputs, using data on maize from Eastern Uganda. Using unique, simultaneous ground data on yields based on farmer reporting, sub-plot crop cutting, and full-plot harvests across hundreds of smallholder plots, we document large discrepancies among the ground-based measures, particularly among yields based on farmer-reporting versus sub-plot or full-plot crop cutting. Compared to yield measures based on either farmer-reporting or sub-plot crop cutting, satellite-based yield measures explain as much or more variation in yields based on (gold-standard) full-plot crop cuts. Further, estimates of the association between maize yield and various production factors (e.g., fertilizer, soil quality) are similar across crop cut- and satellite-based yield measures, with the use of the latter at times leading to more significant results due to larger sample sizes. Overall, the results suggest a substantial role for satellite-based yield estimation in measuring and understanding agricultural productivity in the developing world.},

abstract = {World population will increase 35{\%} by 2050, which may require doubling crop yields on existing farm land to minimize expansion of agriculture into remaining rainforests, wetlands, and grasslands. Whether this is possible depends on closing the gap between yield potential (Yp, yield without pest, disease, nutrient or water stresses, or Yw under water-limited rainfed conditions) and current average farm yields in both developed and developing countries. Quantifying the yield gap is therefore essential to inform policies and prioritize research to achieve food security without environmental degradation. Previous attempts to estimate Yp and Yw at a global level have been too coarse, general, and opaque. Our purpose was to develop a protocol to overcome these limitations based on examples for irrigated rice in China, irrigated and rainfed maize in the USA, and rainfed wheat in Germany. Sensitivity analysis of simulated Yp or Yw found that robust estimates required specific information on crop management, +15 years of observed daily climate data from weather stations in major crop production zones, and coverage of 40-50{\%} of total national production area. National Yp estimates were weighted by potential production within 100-km of reference weather stations. This protocol is appropriate for countries in which crops are mostly grown in landscapes with relatively homogenous topography, such as prairies, plains, large valleys, deltas and lowlands, which account for a majority of global food crop production. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that average farm yields plateau when they reach 75-85{\%} of estimated national Yp, which appears to occur for rice in China and wheat in Germany. Prediction of when average crop yields will plateau in other countries is now possible based on the estimated Yp or Yw ceiling using this protocol. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Remote-sensing data acquired by satellite have a wide scope for agricultural applications owing to their synoptic and repetitive coverage. On the one hand, spectral indices deduced from visible and near-infrared remote-sensing data have been extensively used for crop characterization, biomass estimation, and crop yield monitoring and forecasting. On the other hand, extensive research has been conducted using agrometerological models to estimate soil moisture to produce indicators of plant-water stress. This paper reports the development of an operational spectro-agrometeorological yield model for maize using a spectral index, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from SPOT-VEGETATION, meteorological data obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) model, and crop-water status indicators estimated by the Crop-Specific Water Balance model (CSWB). Official figures produced by the Government of Kenya (GoK) on crop yield, area planted, and production were used in the model. The statistical multiple regression linear model has been developed for six large maize-growing provinces in Kenya. The spectro-agrometerological yield model was validated by comparing the predicted province-level yields with those estimated by GoK. The performance of the NDVI and land cover weighted NDVI (CNDVI) on the yield model was tested. Using CNDVI instead of NDVI in the model reduces 26{\%} of the unknown variance. Of the output indicators of the CSWB model, the actual evapotranspiration (ETA) performs best. CNDVI and ETA in the model explain 83{\%} of the maize crop yield variance with a root square mean error (RMSE) of 0.3298 t ha-1. Very encouraging results were obtained when the Jack-knife re-sampling technique was applied, thus proving the validity of the forecast capability of the model (r2=0.81 and RMSE=0.359 t-1). The optimal prediction capability of the independent variables is 20 days and 30 days for the short and long maize crop cycles, respectively. The national maize production during the first crop season for the years 1998-2003 was estimated with an RMSE of 185 060 t and coefficient of variation of 9{\%}.},

abstract = {New advances in satellite data acquisition and processing offer promise for monitoring agricultural lands globally. Using these data to estimate crop yields for individual fields would benefit both crop management and scientific research, especially for areas where reliable ground-based estimates are not currently made. Here we introduce a generalized approach for mapping crop yields with satellite data and test its predictions for yields across more than 17,000 maize fields and 11,000 soybean fields spanning multiple states and years in the Midwestern United States. The method, termed SCYM (a scalable satellite-based crop yield mapper), uses crop model simulations to train statistical models for different combinations of possible image acquisition dates, and these are then applied to Landsat and gridded weather data within the Google Earth Engine platform, where the Landsat is composited to find the "best" dates of observations on a pixel-by-pixel basis. SCYM estimates successfully captured a significant fraction of maize yield variation in all state-years, with a range of 14-58{\%} and an average of 35{\%} for this particular study region and crop. Similar results were observed for soybean, with an average of 32{\%} of yield variation captured. The multi-year yield estimates were also used to examine the temporal persistence of yield advantages for the top yielding fields in different counties, which is one measure of how important factors such as farmer skill are in explaining yield gaps. The strength of the SCYM approach lies in its ability to leverage physiological knowledge embedded in crop models to interpret satellite observations in a scalable way, as it can be readily applied to new crops, regions, and types and timing of remote sensing observations without the need for ground calibration.},

We evaluated a machine-learning method, Random Forests (RF), for its ability to predict crop yield responses to climate and biophysical variables at global and regional scales in wheat, maize, and potato in comparison with multiple linear regressions (MLR) serving as a benchmark. We used crop yield data from various sources and regions for model training and testing: 1) gridded global wheat grain yield, 2) maize grain yield from US counties over thirty years, and 3) potato tuber and maize silage yield from the northeastern seaboard region. RF was found highly capable of predicting crop yields and outperformed MLR benchmarks in all performance statistics that were compared. For example, the root mean square errors (RMSE) ranged between 6 and 14{\%} of the average observed yield with RF models in all test cases whereas these values ranged from 14{\%} to 49{\%} for MLR models. Our results show that RF is an effective and versatile machine-learning method for crop yield predictions at regional and global scales for its high accuracy and precision, ease of use, and utility in data analysis. RF may result in a loss of accuracy when predicting the extreme ends or responses beyond the boundaries of the training data.},

abstract = {The shortfalls in the quality, quantity, and reliability of agriculture performance data are neither new nor confined to Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is, however, a more dire challenge given the overwhelming importance of agriculture in the economies of most countries in the region in terms of food security and poverty reduction. While farmers' self-reported (SR) data on crop outputs and farm sizes remain popular variables for computing plot productivity and yields, especially in SSA, other methods such GPS measurement and remote sensing measurement of crop area, crop cuts (CC) as well as whole plot harvests have been touted as the gold standard methods for yield measurement. All these approaches to yield estimation are insufficient in capturing real agriculture productivity in rainfed farming systems due to the significant area loss that characterizes these farming systems in the course of each cropping season. This paper compares yield data of smallholder maize plots from two farming communities in the Eastern Region of Ghana based on farmer self-reported outputs and crop cuts, as well as GPS and aerial imagery measurement of plot area. The study finds a high level of agreement between GPS-measured plot area and that measured using remote sensing methods (R2 = 0.80) with the minor deviations between the two measures attributable to changes in farmers' plans in the course of the season with regards to their cultivation extent. More interestingly, the study finds a substantial disparity between measured CC yields and SR yields; 2174 kg/ha for CC yields compared to 651 kg/ha for SR yields. The significant disparity between the two measures of yield is partly attributable to the significant intra-plot variability in crop performance leading to plot area loss in the course of the season. This area loss (ranging from 15 to 30{\%} of the planted area) is usually not taken into account in current yield measurement approaches. Delineating the productive and planted-but-unproductive sections of plots has important implications not only for yield estimation methodologies but also for shedding more light on the factors underlying current poor yields and pathways to improving productivity on smallholder rainfed maize farms.},

Despite improvements in access to high resolution satellite imagery over the last decade and the use of numerous remote-sensing based products by the different systems, there are still fundamental gaps. Based on a questionnaire, discussions with the system experts and the literature, we present the main gaps in the data and in the methods. Finally, we propose some recommendations for addressing these gaps through ongoing improvements in remote sensing, harnessing new and innovative data streams and the continued sharing of more and more data.},

However, Ruaha's carnivore populations cause intense conflict with local people, mainly due to livestock depredation, and are exposed to alarming rates of retaliatory killing, especially on village land adjacent to RNP. Depredation risk is likely to be influenced by both habitat features and livestock husbandry, but the specific environmental risk factors, and relative importance of habitat and husbandry, have never been assessed in this landscape. Here, we assessed which ecogeographic variables (EGVs) were associated with depredation risk for grazing livestock on village land, and generated a predictive map of large carnivore predation risk, based on species distribution modelling algorithms (SDMs). Secondly, we investigated the relative influence of husbandry and EGVs on depredation risk of enclosed stock, based on a generalized linear model. Grazing livestock predation risk was higher closer to rivers, and in areas of lower elevation and low percentage of tree cover, with 41{\%} of the area mapped as high-risk. For enclosed stock, predation risk was mostly influenced by low percentage of tree cover and increased rainfall, with no discernible influence of current husbandry, which suggests that traditional husbandry was insufficient to outweigh the innate predation risks associated with high-risk landscape areas. Adopting new husbandry methods, such as specialised guarding dogs and fortified livestock enclosures, could be valuable for reducing depredation and carnivore killing in the Ruaha landscape.},

abstract = {Enhancing food security while contributing to mitigate climate change and preserving the natural resource base and vital ecosystem services requires the transition to agricultural production systems that are more productive, use inputs more efficiently, are more resilient to climate variability and emit fewer GHGs into the environment. Therefore, quantification of GHGs from agricultural production systems has been the subject of intensive scientific investigation recently to help researchers, development workers, and policy makers to understand how mitigation can be integrated into policy and practice. However, GHG quantification from smallholder production system should also take into account farm productivity to make such research applicable for smallholder farmers. Therefore, estimation of farm productivity should also be an integral consideration when quantifying smallholder mitigation potential. A wide range of methodologies have been developed to estimate crop yields from smallholder production systems. In this chapter, we present the synthesis of the state-of-the-art of crop yield estimation methods along with their advantages and disadvantages. Besides the plot level measurements and sampling, use of crop models and remote sensing are valuable tools for production estimation but detailed parameterization and validation of such tools are necessary before such tools can be used under smallholder production systems. The decision on which method to be used for a particular situation largely depends on the objective, scale of estimation, and desired level of precision. We emphasize that multiple approaches are needed to optimize the resources and also to have precise estimation at different scales.},

abstract = {Maize yield productivity in Ethiopia has been below the genetic potential—constrained, among other factors, by frequent moisture stress due to local weather variability. Changes in climate may exacerbate these limitations to productivity, but current research on projecting responses of maize yields to climate change in Ethiopia is inadequate. The research objectives of this project were to (1) calibrate and evaluate the performance of the APSIM-maize and DSSAT CSM-CERES-Maize models, and (2) assess the impact of climate change on future maize yield. The climate periods considered were near future (2010–2039), middle (2040–2069) and end of the 21st century (2070–2099). Climate simulations were conducted using 20 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Both crop models reasonably reproduced observations for time to anthesis, time to physiological maturity and crop yields, with values for the index of agreement of 0.86, 0.80 and 0.77 for DSSAT, and 0.50, 0.89 and 0.60 for APSIM. Similarly root mean square errors were moderate for days to anthesis (1.3 and 3.7 days, for DSSAT and APSIM, respectively), maturity (4.5 and 3.1 days), and yield (1.1 and 1.2 tons). Deviations of simulated from observed values were low for days to anthesis (DSSAT: −2.4–2.3{\%}; APSIM: 0–6{\%}) and days to maturity (DSSAT: −0.6–4.4{\%}; APSIM: −1.9–3.3{\%}) but relatively high for yield (DSSAT: −18.5–21.2{\%}; APSIM: −19.1–37.1{\%}). Overall the goodness-of-fit measures indicated that models were useful for assessing maize yield at the study site. Simulations for future climate scenarios projected slight increases in the median yield for the near future (1.7{\%}–2.9{\%} across models and RCPs), with uncertainty increasing toward mid-century (0.6–4.2{\%}). By the end of the 21st century, projections ranged between yield decreases by 6.3{\%} and increases by 4{\%}. Differences between the RCPs were small, probably due to factor interactions, such as higher temperatures reducing the CO2-induced yield gains for the higher RCP. Uncertainties in studies on the impact of climate change on maize might arise mostly from the choice of crop model and GCM. Therefore, the use of multiple crop models along with multiple GCMs would be advisable in order to adequately consider uncertainties about future climate and crop responses and to provide comprehensive information to policy makers and planners. Overall, results of this study (based on two different crop simulation models across 20 GCMs, and two RCPs under similar crop management) consistently indicated a slight increase in yield.},

abstract = {Achieving food security in particular in Africa continues to pose a major challenge to humankind. It is clear that the future agricultural potential of Africa plays a critical role in meeting this challenge. Although crop yield can be estimated with a degree of reliability using a limited sample of ground observations, the exact crop acreage and the spatial distribution are rarely available. Even though remote sensing offers the ability to produce a rapid and up-to-date land use and land cover database for agricultural monitoring, there are only a few countries in Africa where higher resolution satellite data such as Landsat have been used for land cover map production at the national level. However a number of global products have been produced which contain information on cropland extent. This paper will outline a comparison of four sources of land cover data to determine which product is the most suitable for agricultural monitoring and for the subsequent development of a crop mask. The land cover products used are the Global Land Cover Map (GLC-2000), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover product (MOD12V1), the SAGE (Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment) and the AFRICOVER dataset from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Both the GLC-2000 and MODIS land cover products are at a resolution of 1 km2 while AFRICOVER, based on visual interpretation of 30-m resolution Landsat images, is available at a much finer resolution. The four land cover products are first aggregated to the same resolution so that they can be compared. The legend categories of the four land cover products in this study are reconciled using the method developed in Fritz and See [Fritz, S. and See, L., 2005, Comparison of land cover maps using fuzzy agreement. International Journal of Geographic Information Science, 19, pp. 787-807.] and See and Fritz [See, L.M. and Fritz, S., 2005, A user-defined fuzzy logic approach to comparing global land cover products. In 14th European Colloquium on Theoretical and Quantitative Geography, 9-12 September 2005, Lisbon, Portugal.] that allows overlap between legend definitions to be taken into account. Once the legend definitions between the different land cover products are reconciled, the maps are then compared with national and sub-national statistics. Analysis is undertaken at both continental and national scales as well as sub-national for Sudan and Eritrea. The study generally concludes that MODIS has the tendency to underestimate cropland cover when compared with FAO statistics or AFRICOVER data, whereas GLC-2000 tends to overestimate crop- land cover in those countries that are located at the northern transition zone of subtropical shrubland and semi-desert areas. In this area MODIS and SAGE show a relatively similar cropland distribution. Even though the SAGE database has been calibrated with national statistics, it does not perform better than the other two datasets overall, and has highlighted the fact that the SAGE data show regional weaknesses and should be replaced in certain regions by more recent datasets such as GLC-2000 and MODIS, or ideally by a hybrid product that combines the best of the three products, depending upon the region and country. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Overcoming the obstacle of frequent cloud coverage in optical remote sensing data is essential for monitoring dynamic land surface processes from space. APiC, a novel adaptable pixel-based compositing and classification approach, is especially designed to use high resolution spatio-temporal space-borne data. Here, pixel-based compositing is used separately for training data and prediction data. First, cloud-free pixels covered by reference data are used within adapted composite periods to compile a training dataset. The compiled training dataset contains samples of spectral reflectances for respective land cover classes at each composite period. For land cover prediction, pixel-based compositing is then applied region-wide. Multiple prediction models are used based on temporal subsets of the compiled training dataset to dynamically account for cloud coverage at pixel level. Thus we present a data-driven classification approach which is applicable in regions with different weather conditions, species composition and phenology. The capability of our method is demonstrated by mapping 19 land cover classes across Germany for the year 2016 based on Sentinel-2A data. Since climatic conditions and thus plant phenology change on a large scale, the classification was carried out separately in six landscape regions of different biogeographical characteristics. The study drew on extensive ground validation data provided by the federal states of Germany. For each landscape region, composite periods of different lengths have been established, which differ regionally in their temporal arrangement as well as in their total number, emphasising the advantage of a flexible regionalised classification procedure. Using a random forest classifier and evaluating outcomes with independent reference data, an overall accuracy of 88{\%} was achieved, with particularly high classification accuracy of around 90{\%} for the major land cover types. We found that class imbalances have significant influence on classification accuracy. Based on multiple temporal subsets of the compiled training dataset, over 10,000 random forest models were calculated and their performance varied considerably across and within landscape regions. The calculated importance of composite periods show that a high temporal resolution of the compiled training dataset is necessary to better capture the different phenology of land cover types. In this study we demonstrate that APiC, due to its data-driven nature, is a very flexible compositing and classification approach making efficient use of dense satellite time series in areas with frequent cloud coverage. Hence, regionalisation can be given greater focus in future broad-scale classifications in order to facilitate better integration of small-scale biophysical conditions and achieve even better results in detailed land cover mapping.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of cultivated area and crop yield are critical to our understanding of agricultural production and food security, particularly for semi-arid regions like the Sahel of West Africa, where crop production is mainly rain-fed and food security is closely correlated with the inter-annual variations in rainfall. Several global and regional land cover products, based on satellite remotely-sensed data, provide estimates of the agricultural land use intensity, but the initial comparisons indicate considerable differences among them, relating to differences in the satellite data quality, classification approaches, and spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we quantify the accuracy of available cropland products across Sahelian West Africa using an independent, high-resolution, visually interpreted sample dataset that classifies all points across West Africa using a 2-km sample grid ({\~{}}500,000 points for the study area). We estimate the "quantity" and "allocation" disagreements for the cropland class of eight land cover products in five Western Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal). The results confirm that coarse spatial resolution (300 m, 500 m, and 1000 m) land cover products have higher disagreements in mapping the fragmented agricultural landscape of the Western Sahel. Earlier products (e.g., GLC2000) are less accurate than recent products (e.g., ESA CCI 2013, MODIS 2013 and GlobCover 2009). We also show that two of the finer spatial resolution maps (GFSAD30, and GlobeLand30) using advanced classification approaches (random forest, decision trees, and pixel-object combined) are currently the best available products for cropland identification. However, none of the eight land cover databases examined is consistent in reaching the targeted 75{\%} accuracy threshold in the five Sahelian countries. The majority of currently available land cover products overestimate cultivated areas by an average of 170{\%} relative to the cropland area in the reference data.},

abstract = {This review of the state of food and agriculture in Islamic countries underlines the need for much greater public commitment to agricultural development. Within the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), 44 member nations, exibiting immense geographic and economic diversity, have come together recently to begin to cooperate on increasing food production. It is difficult to generalize about food production conditions in Islamic nations, but basically, within the OIC, total arable land increased from 159 to 167 ha in the 1970s, a small amount unevenly distributed over the group. Dry-land farming has not received enough public attention, and the dependence on cereals grown under rainfed conditions leaves the population vulnerable to fluctuation. Many of the poorer nations have not given the priority to land improvement that has been successful in Egypt, Pakistan, and some other countries. The economic burden of food imports has become lighter in some countries, although in all it continues to be serious. Net cereal imports to Islamic countries rose from 21 to 39 million tons from 1975-83. An overall increase in the per capita dietary energy supplies masks broad differences between the wealthier and poorer nations of the OIC, and between more and less priviledged populations within the societies. A small proportion of financial commitments to agriculture (15{\%}) come from Islamic community donors; this is not a leading program priority. Often spending has been for large capital-intensive projects depending on imported skills and inputs. As a group, the OIC must plan to take advantage of their technical and environmental diversity, and work together to avoid inefficient dispersal of personnel and other resources. Tabular data show selected indicators of agricultural development (e.g. {\%} of food imported, food production growth), average annual rate of food production change related to population growth, per capita dietary energy supplies, and external assistance commitments.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTHigh food demand has led stakeholders to regularly monitor agricultural production to ensure food security and a balanced ecosystem. Agricultural areas undergo rapid changes throughout a growing season due to phenology. Crop mapping initiatives therefore require efficient and effective information gathering techniques. Remote sensing, specifically radar, offers an effective land-cover mapping platform compared to ground surveying methods. Radar is sensitive to crop physical structure and biomass/vegetation water content, i.e. dielectric property. We adopt and test the potential of the recent Sentinel 1 images for multitemporal crop classification due to its short revisit period and sufficient spatial resolution. The temporal resolution guarantees the highest temporal density of images that captures crop dynamics. However, this presents dimensionality problems in classification algorithms. Therefore, we chose dynamic conditional random fields (DCRFs) and tested their robustness in high-dimensional images constrained to few training data. DCRFs are designed to incorporate spatio-temporal phenological information inherent in images during crop classification. We compare the approach to single epoch classification. Our findings indicate that DCRFs improved crop mapping accuracy in all epochs. Nonetheless, most stakeholders require seasonal crop-type statistics. Hence, we use an ensemble classifier to produce an optimal map from posterior class probabilities estimated from the sequence of images. The ensemble outperforms the conventional approach of merging multitemporal images as composite bands for classification using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC-stack) and mono-temporal conditional random fields. It still retains high accuracy compared to MLC-stack when subjected to high-dimensional images with fewer training data.},

This information is often not available to those affected, key decision makers, or the public. This report aims to overcome this information gap and provide key data needed to facilitate an informed debate about large-scale land acquisition. Its main focus is analytical rather than normative, and its purpose fourfold: Use empirical evidence to inform governments in client countries, especially those with large amounts of land, as well as investors, development partners, and civil society, about what is happening on the ground. Put these events into context and assess their likely long-term impact by identifying global drivers of land supply and demand and highlight how country policies affect land use, household welfare, and distributional outcomes at the local level. Complement the focus on demand for land with a geographically referenced assessment of the supply side, i.e. the availability of potentially suitable agricultural land. Outline options for different actors to minimize risks and capitalize on opportunities to contribute to poverty reduction and economic growth, especially in rural areas. The World Bank recognizes that large scale agricultural investment poses significant challenges which can be addressed successfully only if stakeholders collaborate effectively. Together with FAO, IFAD, UNCTAD and other partners it has formulated seven principles that all involved should adhere to for investments to do no harm, be sustainable, and contribute to development.

abstract = {The emergence of satellite sensors that can routinely observe millions of individual smallholder farms raises possibilities for monitoring and understanding agricultural productivity in many regions of the world. Here we demonstrate the potential to track smallholder maize yield variation in western Kenya, using a combination of 1-m Terra Bella imagery and intensive field sampling on thousands of fields over 2 y. We find that agreement between satellite-based and traditional field survey-based yield estimates depends significantly on the quality of the field-based measures, with agreement highest ([Formula: see text] up to 0.4) when using precise field measures of plot area and when using larger fields for which rounding errors are smaller. We further show that satellite-based measures are able to detect positive yield responses to fertilizer and hybrid seed inputs and that the inferred responses are statistically indistinguishable from estimates based on survey-based yields. These results suggest that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to make predictions of smallholder agricultural productivity that are roughly as accurate as the survey-based measures traditionally used in research and policy applications, and they indicate a substantial near-term potential to quickly generate useful datasets on productivity in smallholder systems, even with minimal or no field training data. Such datasets could rapidly accelerate learning about which interventions in smallholder systems have the most positive impact, thus enabling more rapid transformation of rural livelihoods.},

abstract = {Sustainable intensification (SI) has been proposed as a possible solution to the conflicting problems of meeting projected increases in food demand and preserving environmental quality. SI would provide necessary production increases while simultaneously reducing or eliminating environmental degradation, without taking land from competing demands. An important component of achieving these aims is the development of suitable methods for assessing the temporal variability of both the intensification and sustainability of agriculture. Current assessments rely on traditional data collection methods that produce data of limited spatial and temporal resolution. Earth Observation (EO) provides a readily accessible, long-term dataset with global coverage at various spatial and temporal resolutions. In this paper we demonstrate how EO could significantly contribute to SI assessments, providing opportunities to quantify agricultural intensity and environmental sustainability. We review an extensive body of research on EO-based methods to assess multiple indicators of both agricultural intensity and environmental sustainability. To date these techniques have not been combined to assess SI; here we identify the opportunities and initial steps required to achieve this. In this context, we propose the development of a set of essential sustainable intensification variables (ESIVs) that could be derived from EO data.},

Because of the high contribution of irrigated crops ({\textgreater}80{\%}) to total agricultural production, knowing the spatial distribution and year-to-year variability in irrigated areas is imperative to monitoring food security for the country. We used 16-day composites of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor to create 23-point time series for each year from 2000 through 2013. Seasonal peak values and time series were used in a threshold-dependent decision tree algorithm to map irrigated areas in Afghanistan for the last 14years. In the absence of ground reference irrigated area information, we evaluated these maps with the irrigated areas classified from multiple snapshots of the landscape during the growing season from Landsat 5 optical and thermal sensor images. We were able to identify irrigated areas using Landsat imagery by selecting as irrigated those areas with Landsat-derived NDVI greater than 0.30–0.45, depending on the date of the Landsat image and surface temperature less than or equal to 310 Kelvin (36.9° C). Due to the availability of Landsat images, we were able to compare with the MODIS-derived maps for four years: 2000, 2009, 2010, and 2011. The irrigated areas derived from Landsat agreed well r2=0.91 with the irrigated areas derived from MODIS, providing confidence in the MODIS NDVI threshold approach. The maps portrayed a highly dynamic irrigated agriculture practice in Afghanistan, where the amount of irrigated area was largely determined by the availability of surface water, especially snowmelt, and varied by as much as 30{\%} between water surplus and water deficit years. During the past 14years, 2001, 2004, and 2008 showed the lowest levels of irrigated area ({\~{}}1.5 million hectares), attesting to the severe drought conditions in those years, whereas 2009, 2012 and 2013 registered the largest irrigated area ({\~{}}2.5 million hectares) due to record snowpack and snowmelt in the region. The model holds promise the ability to provide near-real-time (by the end of the growing seasons) estimates of irrigated area, which are beneficial for food security monitoring as well as subsequent decision making for the country. While the model is developed for Afghanistan, it can be adopted with appropriate adjustments in the derived threshold values to map irrigated areas elsewhere.},

abstract = {New remote sensing sensors will acquire High spectral, spatial and temporal Resolution Satellite Image Time Series (HR-SITS). These new data are of great interest to map land cover thanks to the combination of the three high resolutions that will allow a depiction of scene dynamics. However, their efficient exploitation involves new challenges, especially for adapting traditional classification schemes to data complexity. More specifically, it requires: (1) to determine which classifier algorithms can handle the amount and the variability of data; (2) to evaluate the stability of classifier parameters; (3) to select the best feature set used as input data in order to find the good trade-off between classification accuracy and computational time; and (4) to establish the classifier accuracy over large areas. This work aims at studying these different issues, and more especially at demonstrating the ability of state-of-the-art classifiers, such as Random Forests (RF) or Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify HR-SITS. For this purpose, several studies are carried out by using SPOT-4 and Landsat-8 HR-SITS in the south of France. Firstly, the choice of the classifier is discussed by comparing RF and SVM algorithms on HR-SITS. Both classifiers show their ability to tackle the classification problem with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 83.3 {\%} for RF and 77.1 {\%} for SVM. But RF have some advantages such as a small training time, and an easy parameterization. Secondly, the stability of RF parameters is appraised. RF parameters appear to cause little influence on the classification accuracy, about 1{\%} OA difference between the worst and the best parameter configuration. Thirdly, different input data – composed of spectral bands with or without spectral and/or temporal features – are proposed in order to enhance the characterization of land cover. The addition of features improves the classification accuracy, but the gain in OA is weak compared with the increase in the computational cost. Eventually, the classifier accuracy is assessed on a larger area where the landscape variabilities affect the classification performances.},

abstract = {The development of effective and sustainable economic policies for Tanzania requires access to appropriate databases. One such database is a social accounting matrix (SAM) that details the structure of the entire economy, taking into account the patterns of production and demand, and various institutional relationships. Prior to this study the most recent SAM for mainland Tanzania was for 1992 and was based on past household budget and labor force surveys. Following the release of newer versions of these two surveys as well as a new input-output table for 1992, it is desirable to construct a new SAM for the country. Furthermore, given that Tanzania is committed to reducing national poverty, it is necessary that this new SAM is able to address questions related to poverty and inequality. This paper outlines the process of developing SAMs for mainland Tanzania. Although this process was formally a collaborative project undertaken by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the Tanzanian National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the final project team also contained representatives from the Bank of Tanzania, the Tanzanian Revenue Authority, the University of Dar es Salaam, and the Economic and Social Research Foundation (ESRF). The collaboration combined IFPRI's technical experience with the collaborators' knowledge of the country and available statistical data. The SAMs were constructed during a series of workshops held in Tanzania aimed at capacity building, information sharing, and first- hand data validation. Furthermore, the process was made sufficiently flexible to allow the NBS to easily update the SAM to subsequent years. The updating process is also detailed in this paper. Although only the 2000 SAM is described, the process is identical for the other Tanzanian SAMs published by IFPRI for 1998 onwards.},

  abstract  = {The significance of crop yield estimation is well known in agricultural management and policy development at regional and national levels. The primary objective of this study was to test the suitability of the method, depending on predicted crop production, to estimate crop yield with a MODIS-NDVI-based model on a regional scale. In this paper, MODIS-NDVI data, with a 250m resolution, was used to estimate the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield in one of the main winter-wheat-growing regions. Our study region is located in Jining, Shandong Province. In order to improve the quality of remote sensing data and the accuracy of yield prediction, especially to eliminate the cloud-contaminated data and abnormal data in the MODIS-NDVI series, the Savitzky–Golay filter was applied to smooth the 10-day NDVI data. The spatial accumulation of NDVI at the county level was used to test its relationship with winter wheat production in the study area. A linear regressive relationship between the spatial accumulation of NDVI and the production of winter wheat was established using a stepwise regression method. The average yield was derived from predicted production divided by the growing acreage of winter wheat on a county level. Finally, the results were validated by the ground survey data, and the errors were compared with the errors of agro-climate models. The results showed that the relative errors of the predicted yield using MODIS-NDVI are between −4.62{\%} and 5.40{\%} and that whole RMSE was 214.16kgha−1 lower than the RMSE (233.35kgha−1) of agro-climate models in this study region. A good predicted yield data of winter wheat could be got about 40 days ahead of harvest time, i.e. at the booting-heading stage of winter wheat. The method suggested in this paper was good for predicting regional winter wheat production and yield estimation.},

abstract = {Although Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) sensor have been extensively used to assess crop condition and yield on the Canadian Prairies and elsewhere, NDVI data derived from the new moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor have so far not been used for crop yield prediction on the Canadian Prairies. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using MODIS-NDVI to forecast crop yield on the Canadian Prairies and also to identify the best time for making a reliable crop yield forecast. Growing season (May–August) MODIS 10-day composite NDVI data for the years 2000–2006 were obtained from the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS). Crop yield data (i.e., barley, canola, field peas and spring wheat) for each Census Agricultural Region (CAR) were obtained from Statistics Canada. Correlation and regression analyses were performed using 10-day composite NDVI and running average NDVI for 2, 3 and 4 dekads with the highest correlation coefficients (r) as the independent variables and crop grain yield as the dependent variable. To test the robustness and the ability of the generated regression models to forecast crops grain yield, one year at a time was removed and new regression models were developed, which were then used to predict the grain yield for the missing year. Results showed that MODIS-NDVI data can be used effectively to predict crop yield on the Canadian Prairies. Depending on the agro-climatic zone, the power function models developed for each crop accounted for 48 to 90{\%}, 32 to 82{\%}, 53 to 89{\%} and 47 to 80{\%} of the grain yield variability for barley, canola, field peas and spring wheat, respectively, with the best prediction in the semi-arid zone. Overall (54 out of 84), the {\%} difference of the predicted from the actual grain yield was within ±10{\%}. On the whole, RMSE values ranged from 150 to 654, 108 to 475, 204 to 677 and 104 to 714kgha−1 for barley, canola, field peas and spring wheat, respectively. When expressed as percentages of actual yield, the RMSE values ranged from 8 to 25{\%} for barley, 10 to 58{\%} for canola, 10 to 38{\%} for field peas and 6 to 34{\%} for spring wheat. The MAE values followed a similar trend but were slightly lower than the RMSE values. For all the crops, the best time for making grain yield predictions was found to be from the third dekad of June through the third dekad of July in the sub-humid zone and from the first dekad of July through the first dekad of August in both the semi-arid and arid zones. This means that accurate crop grain yield forecasts using the developed regression models can be made one to two months before harvest.},

  abstract  = {Improved understanding of the influence of climate on agricultural production is needed to cope with expected changes in temperature and precipitation, and an increasing number of undernourished people in food insecure regions. Many studies have shown the importance of seasonal climatic means in explaining crop yields. However, climate variability is expected to increase in some regions and have significant consequences on food production beyond the impacts of changes in climatic means. Here, we examined the relationship between seasonal climate and crop yields in Tanzania, focusing on maize, sorghum and rice. The impacts of both seasonal means and variability on yields were measured at the subnational scale using various statistical methods and climate data. The results indicate that both intra- and interseasonal changes in temperature and precipitation influence cereal yields in Tanzania. Seasonal temperature increases have the most important impact on yields. This study shows that in Tanzania, by 2050, projected seasonal temperature increases by 2°C reduce average maize, sorghum, and rice yields by 13{\%}, 8.8{\%}, and 7.6{\%} respectively. Potential changes in seasonal total precipitation as well as intra-seasonal temperature and precipitation variability may also impact crop yields by 2050, albeit to a lesser extent. A 20{\%} increase in intra-seasonal precipitation variability reduces agricultural yields by 4.2{\%}, 7.2{\%}, and 7.6{\%} respectively for maize, sorghum, and rice. Using our preferred model, we show that we underestimate the climatic impacts by 2050 on crop yields in Tanzania by 3.6{\%}, 8.9{\%}, and 28.6{\%} for maize, sorghum and rice respectively if we focus only on climatic means and ignore climate variability. This study highlights that, in addition to shifts in growing season means, changes in intra-seasonal variability of weather may be important for future yields in Tanzania. Additionally, we argue for a need to invest in improving the climate records in these regions to enhance our understanding of these relationships.},

abstract = {Yield gaps are pervasive in African smallholder agriculture, and are large for almost all crops in all regions. There is consensus that poor soil fertility and nutrient availability are the major biophysical limitations to agricultural production in the continent. We identify two major yield gaps: (1) the gap between actual yields (YA) and the water-limited yield potential (Yw), which is the maximum yield achievable under rainfed conditions without irrigation if soil water capture and storage is optimal and nutrient constraints are released, and (2) The gap between YA, and a locally attainable yield (YL) which corresponds to the water and nutrient-limited yields that can be measured in the most productive fields of resource endowed farmers in a community. Estimates of these two yield gaps are given for major crops, together with a framework for how yield gaps can be estimated in a pragmatic way for different farming systems. The paradigm of ecological intensification which focuses on yield potential, soil quality and precision agriculture is explored for the African context. Our analysis suggests that smallholder farmers are unable to benefit from the current yield gains offered by plant genetic improvement. In particular, continued cropping without sufficient inputs of nutrients and organic matter leads to localised but extensive soil degradation and renders many soils in a non-responsive state. The lack of immediate response to increased inputs of fertiliser and labour in such soils constitutes a chronic poverty trap for many smallholder farmers in Africa. This necessitates a rethink for development policy aimed to improve productivity and address problems of food insecurity.},

While these changes will influence agriculture at a broad scale, regional or country-level assessments can miss critical detail. We use high-resolution methods to generate characteristic daily weather data for a combination of different future emission scenarios and climate models to drive detailed simulation models of the maize and bean crops. For the East African region, there is considerable spatial and temporal variation in this crop response. We evaluate the response of maize and beans to a changing climate, as a prelude to detailed targeting of options that can help smallholder households adapt. The results argue strongly against the idea of large, spatially contiguous development domains for identifying and implementing adaptation options, particularly in regions with large variations in topography and current average temperatures. Rather, they underline the importance of localised, community-based efforts to increase local adaptive capacity, take advantage of changes that may lead to increased crop and livestock productivity where this is possible, and to buffer the situations where increased stresses are likely.},

abstract = {Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100–110{\%} increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, ∼1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO2-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching ∼3 Gt y−1 and N use ∼250 Mt y−1 by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only ∼0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of ∼1 Gt y−1, and global N use of ∼225 Mt y−1. Efficient management practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of crop production in smallholder farming systems are critical to the understanding of yield constraints and, thus, setting the appropriate agronomic investments and policies for improving food security and reducing poverty. Nevertheless, mapping the yields of smallholder farms is challenging because of factors such as small field sizes and heterogeneous landscapes. Recent advances in fine-resolution satellite sensors offer promise for monitoring and characterizing the production of smallholder farms. In this study, we investigated the utility of different sensors, including the commercial Skysat and RapidEye satellites and the publicly accessible Sentinel-2, for tracking smallholder maize yield variation throughout a {\~{}}40,000 km2 western Kenya region. We tested the potential of two types of multiple regression models for predicting yield: (i) a "calibrated model", which required ground-measured yield and weather data for calibration, and (ii) an "uncalibrated model", which used a process-based crop model to generate daily vegetation index and end-of-season biomass and/or yield as pseudo training samples. Model performance was evaluated at the field, division, and district scales using a combination of farmer surveys and crop cuts across thousands of smallholder plots in western Kenya. Results show that the "calibrated" approach captured a significant fraction (R2 between 0.3 and 0.6) of yield variations at aggregated administrative units (e.g., districts and divisions), while the "uncalibrated" approach performed only slightly worse. For both approaches, we found that predictions using the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI), which included the red edge band available in RapidEye and Sentinel-2, were superior to those made using other commonly used vegetation indices. We also found that multiple refinements to the crop simulation procedures led to improvements in the "uncalibrated" approach. We identified the prevalence of small field sizes, intercropping management, and cloudy satellite images as major challenges to improve the model performance. Overall, this study suggested that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to map yields of smallholder farming systems, and the methodology presented in this study could serve as a good foundation for other smallholder farming systems in the world.},

abstract = {Human-elephant conflict poses a major threat to elephants in many parts of Asia, including Sri Lanka. We studied human-elephant conflict in two areas with contrasting scenarios of landuse and conflict, Kahalle and Yala. Kahalle was developed and settled under the Mahaweli irrigation project and the main agricultural practice was irrigated agriculture, with two annual growing seasons. The area was a mosaic of settlements, agriculture, and small forest patches with ill defined human- and elephant-use areas. Elephants ranged within the habitat mosaic year round, occupying remnant forest patches and raiding adjacent crops at night. In contrast, Yala was dominated by a large protected area complex, and the main agricultural methods were slash-and-burn agriculture and rain-fed paddy cultivation. Human- and elephant-use areas were well defined and segregated. The protected area provided elephants with a refuge and food during the rainy season, when the single annual crop was grown. During the dry season, elephants moved into slash-and-burn areas and utilized leftover crops and pioneer vegetation in fallow fields. The landuse pattern and agricultural practices in Yala facilitated co-existence, whereas that in Kahalle led to year round conflict. We suggest that areas managed according to traditional landuse practices should be part of an elephant conservation strategy, where people and elephants have to share resources.},

abstract = {Human-wildlife conflicts, especially those involving large carnivores, are of global conservation and livelihood concern and require effective and locally-adapted prevention measures. Risk of lion attack on livestock (i.e., depredation) may vary seasonally and may be associated with variation in wild prey abundance or landscape characteristics. To test these competing hypotheses, we used a resource selection approach, and determined whether prey catchability (indicated by geo-spatial variables), or prey availability (indicated by modeled abundance recorded via camera traps) explained spatial and seasonal variation in livestock depredation risk by African lions on Manyara Ranch Conservancy, a multi-use area in northern Tanzania. Seasonal variation in vegetative productivity and proximity to surface water appeared to be strong predictors of livestock depredation risk. Correlates for depredation risk were different between wet and dry seasons. During the dry season, depredation risk was positively correlated with vegetative productivity, whereas depredation risk during the wet season was highest near livestock enclosures (bomas). During both seasons, depredation risk was high closer to surface water. Landscape-driven risk maps were created to identify low risk areas that may be compatible with livestock grazing. Our results on depredation risk by lions are similar to other studies in protected areas and suggest that both prey catchability and prey availability are instrumental in predicting kill sites of lions. To facilitate lion and livestock coexistence in multi-use areas of Africa, we recommend minimizing spatiotemporal overlap between livestock and abundant wild prey by developing alternative livestock water and feeding locations and increasing caution near surface water areas.},

In addition, there is a growing awareness of the value of wild felids as key components of ecosystems, tourist attractions gener- ating income, umbrella species for conserving ecosys- tems, and flagships for engendering public support for conservation. These positive values sometimes con- trast strongly with the relationship between wild felids and people in areas where they coexist. Human con- flicts with wild cats, overexploitation of felid and prey populations, and habitat loss and fragmentation have extirpated felid populations and still threaten many more. The ways in which people value and interact with organisms and their habitats is at the heart of conservation.

People compete with wildlife for food and resources, and have eradicated dangerous species; co-opted and domesticated valuable species; and applied a wide range of social, behavioral, and technical approaches to reduce negative interactions with wildlife. This conflict has led to the extinction and reduction of numerous species and uncountable human deaths and economic losses. Recent advances in our understanding of conflict have led to a growing number of positive conservation and coexistence outcomes. I summarize and synthesize factors that contribute to conflict, approaches that mitigate conflict and encourage coexistence, and emerging trends and debates. Fertile areas for scholarship include scale and complexity, models and scenarios, understanding generalizable patterns, expanding boundaries of what is considered conflict, using new tools and technologies, information sharing and collaboration, and the implications of global change. The time may be ripe to identify a new field, anthrotherology, that brings together scholars and practitioners from different disciplinary perspectives to address human–wildlife conflict and coexistence.},

  abstract  = {Few universal trends in spatial patterns of wildlife crop-raiding have been found. Variations in wildlife ecology and movements, and human spatial use have been identified as causes of this apparent unpredictability. However, varying spatial patterns of spatial autocorrelation (SA) in human–wildlife conflict (HWC) data could also contribute. We explicitly explore the effects of SA on wildlife crop-raiding data in order to facilitate the design of future HWC studies. We conducted a comparative survey of raided and nonraided fields to determine key drivers of crop-raiding. Data were subsampled at different spatial scales to select independent raiding data points. The model derived from all data was fitted to subsample data sets. Model parameters from these models were compared to determine the effect of SA. Most methods used to account for SA in data attempt to correct for the change in P-values; yet, by subsampling data at broader spatial scales, we identified changes in regression estimates. We consequently advocate reporting both model parameters across a range of spatial scales to help biological interpretation. Patterns of SA vary spatially in our crop-raiding data. Spatial distribution of fields should therefore be considered when choosing the spatial scale for analyses of HWC studies. Robust key drivers of elephant crop-raiding included raiding history of a field and distance of field to a main elephant pathway. Understanding spatial patterns and determining reliable socio-ecological drivers of wildlife crop-raiding is paramount for designing mitigation and land-use planning strategies to reduce HWC. Spatial patterns of HWC are complex, determined by multiple factors acting at more than one scale; therefore, studies need to be designed with an understanding of the effects of SA. Our methods are accessible to a variety of practitioners to assess the effects of SA, thereby improving the reliability of conservation management actions.},

abstract = {Conflict between people and felids is one of the most urgent wild cat conservation issues worldwide, yet efforts to synthesize knowledge about these conflicts have been few. For management strategies to be effective a thorough understanding of the dynamics of human-felid conflicts is necessary. Here we present the results of a cross-species, systematic review of human-felid conflicts worldwide. Using a combination of literature review and geographical information system analyses, we provide a quantitative as well as qualitative assessment of patterns and determinants that are known to influence the severity of human-felid conflicts, and a geographical overview of the occurrence of conflict worldwide. We found evidence of conflict affecting over 75{\%} of the world's felid species. The severity of conflict increases with felid body mass and is of greatest conservation significance to nine species: caracal, cheetah, Eurasian lynx, jaguar, leopard, lion, puma, snow leopard and tiger. We also reveal specific gaps in knowledge about human-felid conflicts, and required actions within this aspect of felid conservation. With only 31{\%} of implemented management strategies having been evaluated scientifically, there is a need for greater and more rigorous evaluation and a wider dissemination of results. Also urgently required are standardized reporting techniques to reduce the current disparity in conflict reporting methods and facilitate resolution of patterns and trends in the scale of human-felid conflict worldwide. This review provides a basis both for further synthesis and for the coordination of human-felid conflict management among researchers, practitioners and organizations. {\textcopyright} Fauna {\&} Flora International 2009.},

Translocating "problem-elephants" is an important HEC mitigation and elephant conservation strategy across elephant range, with hundreds translocated annually. In the first comprehensive assessment of elephant translocation, we monitored 16 translocations in Sri Lanka with GPS collars. All translocated elephants were released into national parks. Two were killed within the parks where they were released, while all the others left those parks. Translocated elephants showed variable responses: "homers" returned to the capture site, "wanderers" ranged widely, and "settlers" established home ranges in new areas soon after release. Translocation caused wider propagation and intensification of HEC, and increased elephant mortality. We conclude that translocation defeats both HEC mitigation and elephant conservation goals.},

Agricultural losses involve damage to food crops, cash crops, and even food in storage, with absorption of any loss at the individual household level. The associated social costs are intangible, difficult to quantify, and highly significant. Elephants are a convenient medium for widespread and persistent complaint from rural communities against wildlife conservation initiatives. HEC displays complex spatial dynamics across landscapes. Nearly a decade of investigation coordinated by the IUCN AfESG has revealed several key principles for HEC mitigation. The approach to dealing with this problem needs to be applied at a variety of management scales and is as much an art as a science.},

Systematic monitoring of crop loss to wildlife (mammals larger than 3 kg) and livestock was conducted in six villages around Kibale over a 2-year period. Five wildlife species accounted for 85{\%} of crop damage events: baboons, bushpigs, redtail monkeys, chimpanzees, and elephants. Marked variation in frequency and extent of damage is reported within villages, between villages, and between wildlife species. Fields lying within 500 m of the forest boundary, lost 4-7{\%} of crops per season on average, but the distribution of damage was highly skewed such that maize and cassava fields were on occasion completely destroyed. Multivariate analysis was used to test predictors of damage, including human population density, guarding, hunting, sight distance, and distance from the forest. Tests were performed at two levels of analysis, field and village. Distance from the forest edge explained the greatest amount of variation in crop damage, although hunting also influenced the extent of crop damage. Elephants inflicted catastrophic damage to farms but their forays were rare and highly localized. Livestock caused considerable damage to crops but farmers seldom complained because they, had institutionalized modes of restitution. Although most of the crop damage by wildlife is restricted to a narrow, band of farmers living near the forest edge, risk perception among these farmers has been amplified by legal prohibitions on killing wild animals. Elevating local tolerance for wildlife will require diverse approaches, including channeling economic benefits to Kibale's neighbors and providing compensation in limited cases.},

abstract = {We define African savannahs as being those areas that receive between 300 and 1,500 mm of rain annually. This broad definition encompasses a variety of habitats. Thus defined, savannahs comprise 13.5 million km2 and encompass most of the present range of the African lion (Panthera leo). Dense human populations and extensive conversion of land to human use preclude use by lions. Using high-resolution satellite imagery and human population density data we define lion areas, places that likely have resident lion populations. In 1960, 11.9 million km2 of these savannahs had fewer than 25 people per km2. The comparable area shrank to 9.7 million km2 by 2000. Areas of savannah Africa with few people have shrunk considerably in the last 50 years and human population projections suggest they will likely shrink significantly in the next 40. The current extent of free-ranging lion populations is 3.4 million km2 or about 25 {\%} of savannah area. Habitats across this area are fragmented; all available data indicate that between 32,000 and 35,000 free-ranging lions live in 67 lion areas. Although these numbers are similar to previous estimates, they are geographically more comprehensive. There is abundant evidence of widespread declines and local extinctions. Under the criteria we outline, ten lion areas qualify as lion strongholds: four in East Africa and six in Southern Africa. Approximately 24,000 lions are in strongholds, with an additional 4,000 in potential ones. However, over 6,000 lions are in populations of doubtful long-term viability. Lion populations in West and Central Africa are acutely threatened with many recent, local extinctions even in nominally protected areas. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {* Like many wildlife populations across Africa, recent analyses indicate that African lions are declining rapidly outside of small fenced areas. Community conservancies – privately protected areas that engage community members in conservation – may potentially maintain wildlife populations in unfenced pastoralist regions, but their effectiveness in conserving large carnivores has been largely unknown until now.


* We identify drivers of lion survival in community conservancies within the Masai Mara ecosystem, Kenya, applying mark–recapture analyses to continuous sight–resight surveys. We use the number of livestock and human settlements as proxies for potential human–lion conflict whilst controlling for environmental variables and lion socioecology.


* Average lion densities within the Mara conservancies between 2008 and 2013 (11{\textperiodcentered}87 lions 100 km−2) were 2{\textperiodcentered}6 times higher than those previously reported in 2003. Survival rates varied amongst prides and were highest for lions utilizing central regions of conservancies.


* The number of livestock settlements (bomas [corrals] and manyattas) that were not members of a conservancy, and that fell within a pride home-range, had a large negative effect on female survival and was the most influential external predictor in models. These non-conservancy settlements accounted for 37{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} of total observed variation in survival, whereas conservancy settlements, which benefit financially from wildlife through their membership, had no effect on lion survival.


* Internal drivers of survival agreed with known ecology and social behaviour including age plus a negative effect of male takeovers on cub survival {\textless}6 months. Vegetation cover, prey availability and the density of grazing livestock within a pride's range did not explain patterns in lion survival.


* Synthesis and applications. We show that lion densities have increased substantially within the Mara conservancies over the last decade and suggest that the creation of community conservancies has benefitted their survival. This suggests that lions can survive outside of fenced areas within pastoral regions if communities gain benefits from wildlife. We highlight the importance of expanding existing conservancies beyond their current geographical and political scope and forming buffer zones if wildlife ranges outside them. We suggest that changing attitudes to predators should be a key goal of community-based conservancies. Further work is recommended to identify what specific aspects of conservancy membership promote lion survival.},

abstract = {Background: The largest terrestrial species in the order Carnivora are wide-ranging and rare because of their positions at the top of food webs. They are some of the world's most admired mammals and, ironically, some of the most imperiled. Most have experienced substantial population declines and range contractions throughout the world during the past two centuries. Because of the high metabolic demands that come with endothermy and large body size, these carnivores often require large prey and expansive habitats. These food requirements and wide-ranging behavior often bring them into confl ict with humans and livestock. This, in addition to human intolerance, renders them vulnerable to extinction. Large carnivores face enormous threats that have caused massive declines in their populations and geographic ranges, including habitat loss and degradation, persecution, utilization, and depletion of prey. We highlight how these threats can affect the conservation status and ecological roles of this planet's 31 largest carnivores. Advances: Based on empirical studies, trophic cascades have been documented for 7 of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores (not including pinnipeds). For each of these species (see fi gure), human actions have both caused declines and contributed to recovery, providing "natural experiments" for quantifying their effects on food-web and community structure. Large carnivores deliver economic and ecosystem services via direct and indirect pathways that help maintain mammal, avian, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness. Further, they affect other ecosystem processes and conditions, such as scavenger subsidies, disease dynamics, carbon storage, stream morphology, and crop production. The maintenance or recovery of ecologically effective densities of large carnivores is an important tool for maintaining the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Outlook: Current ecological knowledge indicates that large carnivores are necessary for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem function. Human actions cannot fully replace the role of large carnivores. Additionally, the future of increasing human resource demands and changing climate will affect biodiversity and ecosystem resiliency. These facts, combined with the importance of resilient ecosystems, indicate that large carnivores and their habitats should be maintained and restored wherever possible. Preventing the extinction of these species and the loss of their irreplaceable ecological function and importance will require novel, bold, and deliberate actions. We propose a Global Large Carnivore Initiative to coordinate local, national, and international research, conservation, and policy.},

abstract = {Tanzania's Ruaha landscape, centred around Ruaha National Park (RNP), is an international priority area for large carnivores, supporting {\textgreater}10{\%} of the world's lions (Panthera leo) and globally significant populations of leopards (Panthera pardus), spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) and other carnivores. However, Ruaha's carnivore populations cause intense conflict with local people, mainly due to livestock depredation, and are exposed to alarming rates of retaliatory killing, especially on village land adjacent to RNP. Depredation risk is likely to be influenced by both habitat features and livestock husbandry, but the specific environmental risk factors, and relative importance of habitat and husbandry, have never been assessed in this landscape. Here, we assessed which ecogeographic variables (EGVs) were associated with depredation risk for grazing livestock on village land, and generated a predictive map of large carnivore predation risk, based on species distribution modelling algorithms (SDMs). Secondly, we investigated the relative influence of husbandry and EGVs on depredation risk of enclosed stock, based on a generalized linear model. Grazing livestock predation risk was higher closer to rivers, and in areas of lower elevation and low percentage of tree cover, with 41{\%} of the area mapped as high-risk. For enclosed stock, predation risk was mostly influenced by low percentage of tree cover and increased rainfall, with no discernible influence of current husbandry, which suggests that traditional husbandry was insufficient to outweigh the innate predation risks associated with high-risk landscape areas. Adopting new husbandry methods, such as specialised guarding dogs and fortified livestock enclosures, could be valuable for reducing depredation and carnivore killing in the Ruaha landscape.},

abstract = {A major challenge in carnivore conservation worldwide is identifying priority human–carnivore conflict sites where mitigation efforts would be most effective. Spatial predation risk modeling recently emerged as a tool for predicting and mapping hotspots of livestock depredation using locations where carnivores attacked livestock in the past. This literature review evaluates the approaches and applications of spatial risk modeling for reducing human–carnivore conflict and presents a workflow to help conservation practitioners use this tool. Over the past decade 18 studies were published, most which examined canid and felid (10 and 8 studies on each group, respectively) depredation on cattle (14) and sheep (12). Studies employed correlation modeling, spatial association and/or spatial interpolation to identify high-risk landscape features, and many (but not all) validated models with independent data. The landscape features associated with carnivore attacks related to the species (carnivore and prey), environment, human infrastructure and management interventions. Risk maps from most studies (14) were used to help livestock owners and managers identify top-priority areas for implementing carnivore deterrents, with some efforts achieving {\textgreater}90 {\%} reductions in attacks. Only one study affected policy, highlighting a gap where risk maps could be useful for more clearly communicating information to assist policymakers with large-scale decisions on conflict. Studies were used to develop a six-step workflow on integrating risk modeling into conservation. This review reveals a need for future predation risk modeling to focus more on validating models, accounting for feedbacks and impacting conflict-related policy in order to reliably improve the mitigation of human–carnivore conflict globally.},

but their efficacy is rarely assessed in a randomized case–control design. Further, the
economic costs prevent the adoption and wide use of conflict mitigation strategies
by pastoralists in rural Africa. We examined carnivore (African lion [Panthera leo],
leopard [Panthera pardus], spotted hyena [Crocuta crocuta], jackal [Canis mesomelas],
and cheetah [Acinonyx jubatus]) raids on fortified (n = 45, total 631 monthly visits) and
unfortified (traditional, n = 45, total 521 monthly visits) livestock enclosures (“bomas”)
in northern Tanzania. The study aimed to (a) assess the extent of retaliatory killings
of major carnivore species due to livestock depredation, (b) describe the spatiotemporal characteristics of carnivore raids on livestock enclosures, (c) analyze whether
spatial covariates influenced livestock depredation risk in livestock enclosures, and
(d) examine the cost-effectiveness of livestock enclosure fortification. Results suggest that (a) majority of boma raids by carnivores were caused by spotted hyenas
(nearly 90{\%} of all raids), but retaliatory killings mainly targeted lions, (b) carnivore raid
attempts were rare at individual households (0.081 raid attempts/month in fortified
enclosures and 0.102 raid attempts/month in unfortified enclosures), and (c) spotted
hyena raid attempts increased in the wet season compared with the dry season, and
owners of fortified bomas reported less hyena raid attempts than owners of unfortified bomas. Landscape and habitat variables tested, did not strongly drive the spatial
patterns of spotted hyena raids in livestock bomas. Carnivore raids varied randomly
both spatially (village to village) and temporally (year to year). The cost-benefit analysis suggest that investing in boma fortification yielded positive net present values
after two to three years. Thus, enclosure fortification is a cost-effective strategy to
promote coexistence of carnivores and humans},

abstract = {ESA's upcoming satellite Sentinel-2 will provide Earth images of high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution and aims to ensure continuity for Landsat and SPOT observations. In comparison to the latter sensors, Sentinel-2 incorporates three new spectral bands in the red-edge region, which are centered at 705, 740 and 783 nm. This study addresses the importance of these new bands for the retrieval and monitoring of two important biophysical parameters: green leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (Ch). With data from several ESA field campaigns over agricultural sites (SPARC, AgriSAR, CEFLES2) we have evaluated the efficacy of two empirical methods that specifically make use of the new Sentinel-2 bands. First, it was shown that LAI can be derived from a generic normalized difference index (NDI) using hyperspectral data, with 674 nm with 712 nm as best performing bands. These bands are positioned closely to the Sentinel-2 B4 (665 nm) and the new red-edge B5 (705 nm) band. The method has been applied to simulated Sentinel-2 data. The resulting green LAI map was validated against field data of various crop types, thereby spanning a LAI between 0 and 6, and yielded a RMSE of 0.6. Second, the recently developed -Normalized Area Over reflectance Curve{\{}norm of matrix{\}} (NAOC), an index that derives Ch from hyperspectral data, was studied on its compatibility with simulated Sentinel-2 data. This index integrates the reflectance curve between 643 and 795 nm, thereby including the new Sentinel-2 bands in the red-edge region. We found that these new bands significantly improve the accuracy of Ch estimation. Both methods emphasizethe importance of red-edge bands for operational estimation of biophysical parameters from Sentinel-2. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of maize yields at field or subfield scales are useful for guiding agronomic practices and investments and policies for improving food security. Data on smallholder maize systems are currently sparse, but satellite remote sensing offers promise for accelerating learning about these systems. Here we document the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to build “wall-to-wall” 10 m resolution maps of (i) cropland presence, (ii) maize presence, and (iii) maize yields for the main 2017 maize season in Kenya and Tanzania. Mapping these outcomes at this scale is extremely challenging because of very heterogeneous landscapes, lack of cloud-free satellite imagery, and the low quantity of quality ground-based data in these regions. First, we computed seasonal median composites of Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 optical reflectance measures for each pixel in the region, and used them to build both crop/non-crop and maize/non-maize Random Forest (RF) classifiers. Several thousand crop/non-crop labels were collected through an in-house GEE labeler, and thousands of crop type labels from the 2015–2017 growing seasons were obtained from various sources. Results show that the crop/non-crop classifier successfully identified cropland with over 85{\%} out-of-sample accuracy in both countries, with Sentinel-1 being particularly useful for prediction. Among the cropped pixels, the maize/non-maize classier had an accuracy of 79{\%} in Tanzania and 63{\%} in Kenya. To map maize yields, we build on past work using a scalable crop yield mapper (SCYM) that utilizes simulations from a crop model to train a regression that predicts yields from observations. Here we advance past approaches by (i) grouping simulations by Global Agro-Environmental Stratification (GAES) zones across the two countries, in order to account for landscape heterogeneity, (ii) utilizing gridded datasets on soil and sowing and harvest dates to setup model simulations in a scalable way; and (iii) utilizing all available satellite observations during the growing season in a parsimonious way by using harmonic regression fits implemented in GEE. SCYM estimates were able to capture about 50{\%} of the variation in the yields at the district level in Western Kenya as measured by objective ground-based crop cuts. Finally, we illustrated the utility of our yield maps with two case studies. First, we document the magnitude and interannual variability of spatial heterogeneity of yields in each district, and how it varies for different parts of the region. Second, we combine our estimates with recently released soil databases in the region to investigate the most important soil constraints in the region. Soil factors explain a high fraction (72{\%}) of variation in predicted yields, with the predominant factor being soil nitrogen levels. Overall, this study illustrates the power of combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, the GEE platform, and advanced classification and yield mapping algorithms to advance understanding of smallholder agricultural systems.},

The results indicate that crop raiding differed significantly on farms along a distance gradient from the protected area. Baboons were reported to be the most destructive wild animals, followed by elephants, which were destructive especially in the villages located near the protected area. Wild animals caused significant economic losses for households. We recommend further studies on the crop yield gap caused by crop-raiding wild animals and human-primate conflict in communities around protected areas.

abstract = {Temporal patterns of crop raiding by elephants were studied for 13 months in 1996/1997 at Kibale Forest National Park, Uganda. To determine the influence of environmental factors on the timing of raiding, we tested for correlations between crop raiding patterns and the quality of natural forage within the forest as well as crop availability beyond park boundaries. Crop raiding occurred throughout the year with peaks in dry seasons when crop availability was high. Bananas and maize were the main crops raided. Variations in forage quality were moderate with small seasonal fluctuations and peaks in dry seasons. Monthly crop raiding incidences were not influenced by forage quality but by ripening of maize. Comparison of forage quality and temporal distribution of crop raiding between savanna and forest habitats suggests that crop availability is more important in forest habitats, whereas in savanna habitats large seasonal fluctuations in forage quality have a greater influence on temporal patterns of crop raiding. {\textcopyright} 2005 African Journal of Ecology.},

abstract = {In the western Serengeti of Tanzania, African elephant Loxodonta africana populations are increasing, which is rare across the species' range. Here, conservation objectives come into conflict with competing interests such as agriculture. Elephants regularly damage crops, which threatens livelihoods and undermines local support for conservation. For damage reduction efforts to be successful, limited resources must be used efficiently and strategies for mitigation and prevention should be informed by an understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of crop damage. We assessed historical records of crop damage by elephants to describe the dynamics and context of damage in the western Serengeti. We used binary data and generalized additive models to predict the probability of crop damage at the village level in relation to landscape features and metrics of human disturbance. During 2012–2014 there were 3,380 reports of crop damage by elephants submitted to authorities in 42 villages. Damage was concentrated in villages adjacent to a reserve boundary and peaked during periods of crop maturity and harvest. The village-level probability of crop damage was negatively associated with distance from a reserve, positively with length of the boundary shared with a reserve, and peaked at moderate levels of indicators of human presence. Spatially aggregated historical records can provide protected area managers and regional government agencies with important insights into the distribution of conflict across the landscape and between seasons, and can guide efforts to optimize resource allocation and future land use planning efforts.},

abstract = {Crop damage is the most common impact of negative interactions between people and elephants and poses a significant threat to rural livelihoods and conservation efforts. Numerous approaches to mitigate and prevent crop damage have been implemented throughout Africa and Asia. Despite the documented high efficacy of many approaches, losses remain common, and in many areas, damage is intensifying. We examined the literature on effectiveness of crop-damage-mitigation strategies and identified key gaps in evaluations. We determined there is a need to better understand existing solutions within affected communities and to extend evaluations of effectiveness beyond measurement of efficacy to include rates of and barriers to adoption. We devised a conceptual framework for evaluating effectiveness that incorporates the need for increased emphasis on adoption and can be used to inform the design of future crop-damage mitigation assessments for elephants and conflict species more widely. The ability to prevent crop loss in practice is affected by both the efficacy of a given approach and rates of uptake among target users. We identified the primary factors that influence uptake as local attitudes, sustainability, and scalability and examined each of these factors in detail. We argue that even moderately efficacious interventions may make significant progress in preventing damage if widely employed and recommend that wherever possible scientists and practitioners engage with communities to build on and strengthen existing solutions and expertise. When new approaches are required, they should align with local attitudes and fit within limitations on labor, financial requirements, and technical capacity.},

abstract = {Coexistence between subsistence farmers and elephants leads to problems for conservation and food security, especially on the edge of protected areas. Crop-raiding patterns have been investigated for decades, but understanding both social and ecological determinants remains a key challenge to defining realistic management options in a context of increasing human and elephant densities. Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, and its periphery, hosts one of the highest densities of free-ranging elephants. As scale is a critical element of ecological systems, we analysed the determinants of crop raiding at three spatial scales: the study area (217 households in 200 km 2), the village (30 fields in 14 km 2) and the edge of the refuge area (30 fields in less than 3 km 2). We combined foraging ecology with sociological approaches, including a participatory experiment, to understand the processes behind the susceptibility of subsistence farmers to crop raiding. Distance to refuge area was the most influential determinant in decreasing crop-raiding risk, with no damage occurring further than 4{\textperiodcentered}4 km. We obtained consistent models between the three scales with high explanatory power for field damage at village and edge scales (94{\%} and 68{\%} respectively). Household density acted as an obstacle to elephants. Millet patches seemed to provide refuges, and thus promoted damage. The participatory experiment allowed rigorous testing of the efficiency of traditional guarding practices. The presence of people was crucial for guarding efficiency. More innovatively, we demonstrated the role of neighbours and the importance of cohesive guarding as a promising strategy of reducing crop loss at the edge, primarily in areas with a high density of elephant paths. Synthesis and applications. This paper provides evidence that multi-scale multidisciplinary approaches can unravel endogenous processes shaping human-elephant coexistence on the edge of protected areas. We believe that manipulating perceived risks for elephants, through mitigation methods based on the 'ecology of fear', and spatial organization of households, could create a 'soft fence' which, when combined with adequate incentives to farmers, promotes a better integration of the protected area in its territory. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Much has been written about insect damage to standing crops, but an area that has received little attention within agricultural development, conservation, and primatological literature is that of primates and the potential damage they can cause to farmers' fields. This is likely to become an increasingly important issue for people interested in primates, as conservation projects adopt a more integrated approach to take account of local people's perspectives and needs. The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of crop raiding by primates, particularly baboons, on farmers living around the southern edge of the Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda. I use data gathered during monthly farm surveys and informal discussion groups, along with time budget data, to demonstrate that 1) baboons can cause extensive damage to field crops, such as maize and cassava; 2) proximity of the farm to the forest edge and the presence or absence of neighboring farms affect the likelihood of any farm sustaining crop damage from baboons; and 3) in addition to the direct costs associated with crop losses attributed to baboon foraging activity, there are indirect costs of baboon crop raiding such as increased labor demands to protect crops from them and, occasionally, to replant crop stands badly damaged by baboons. These results have important implications for future primate conservation policy and practice.},

To understand crop foraging and its value to wildlife or its implications for humans requires a cross-disciplinary approach that considers the behavior and ecology of wild animals engaging in this behavior; the types and levels of competition for resources between people and wildlife; people's perceptions of and attitudes toward wildlife, including animals that forage on crops; and discourse about animals and their behaviors and how these discourses can be used for expressing dissent and distress about other social conflicts.

Maasai retaliate against lions, leopards and hyenas that prey upon their livestock. Cattle depredation is mostly by lions and most common in grazing herds tended solely by children (rather than by warriors) and in large herds tended by few herders. Depredation on sheep and goats (shoats) is mostly by leopards and is more difficult to prevent. Across all carnivore species, nocturnal depredation is somewhat more common in smaller households. Over most of the NCA, lion killing is proportional to the amount of cattle depredation by resident lions, but nomadic lions from the Serengeti National Park appear to be killed more exclusively for cultural purposes (Ala-mayo) in the open plains. While the impact of ritual hunting on the Serengeti lion population as a whole appears to be trivial, retaliatory killing on resident lions in the NCA may intensify as the human population continues to increase. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

The intensity of verbally expressed attitudes was heavily dependent on whether the attitude object was of a general or a specific category. Level of self-reported fear was much higher for specific species of large carnivores than for broad verbal categories like concern over safety due to carnivores in general. Women were more afraid than men. The elderly expressed lower fear than other age groups, but only in response to the general category question. Level of fear was positively correlated with educational level. For almost all questions, villagers living further away from the national park expressed more fear than villagers living closer to the park. Fear can influence attitudes toward wildlife. Understanding whether encounters with wildlife are experienced as positive or negative can help in forming management strategies that are effective in reducing human–wildlife conflicts. {\textcopyright} 2006 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Increasing habitat fragmentation and human population growth in Africa has resulted in an escalation in human–elephant conflict between small-scale farmers and free-ranging African elephants (Loxodonta Africana). In 2012 Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) implemented the national 10-year Conservation and Management Strategy for the Elephant in Kenya, which includes an action aimed at testing whether beehive fences can be used to mitigate human–elephant conflict. From 2012 to 2015, we field-tested the efficacy of beehive fences to protect 10 0.4-ha farms next to Tsavo East National Park from elephants. We hung a series of beehives every 10 m around the boundary of each farm plot. The hives were linked with strong wire. After an initial pilot test with 2 farms, the remaining 8 of 10 beehive fences also contained 2-dimensional dummy hives between real beehives to help reduce the cost of the fence. Each trial plot had a neighboring control plot of the same size within the same farm. Of the 131 beehives deployed 88{\%} were occupied at least once during the 3.5-year trial. Two hundred and fifty-three elephants, predominantly 20–45 years old entered the community farming area, typically during the crop- ripening season. Eighty percent of the elephants that approached the trial farms were kept out of the areas protected by the beehive fences, and elephants that broke a fence were in smaller than average groups. Beehive fences not only kept large groups of elephants from invading the farmland plots but the farmers also benefited socially and financially from the sale of 228 kg of elephant-friendly honey. As news of the success of the trial spread, a further 12 farmers requested to join the project, bringing the number of beehive fence protected farms to 22 and beehives to 297. This demonstrates positive adoption of beehive fences as a community mitigation tool. Understanding the response of elephants to the beehive fences, the seasonality of crop raiding and fence breaking, and the willingness of the community to engage with the mitigation method will help contribute to future management strategies for this high human–elephant conflict hotspot and other similar areas in Kenya.},

The factors determining the effectiveness of electric fences are not fully understood. We assessed the performance of Namelok and Kimana fences in reducing human-elephant conflict by comparing the frequency of crop-raiding by elephants and the perceptions of farmers on the effect of the fences in reducing elephant crop-raiding within fenced and adjacent unfenced farmlands. We also examined the effect of intact fence wires, presence of currentand amount of voltage on fence breakage by elephants. Electric fencing reduced elephant crop-raiding and other forms of human-elephant conflicts. Namelok fence was not broken by elephants whereas Kimana fence was broken several times probably because it borders Kimana Sanctuary which provided cover where elephants could retreat after crop-raiding. The mere presence of current did not minimize fence breakage by elephants. Elephants entered fenced areas more frequently when the fence wires were broken than when wires were intact. Our results suggest that, location of fences in relation to landscape factors, maintenance of effective non-electrified fences and proximity of fences to areas of high elephant concentration are significant determinants of fence performance in mitigating elephant crop-raiding.},

Results indicate that probability of attack increases with proximity to villages and in areas with a large proportion of open woodland/bushland and crops. Attack risks are also affected by distance from protected areas and by changes in grassland, grassland with crops, wetlands and bare areas. The statistical model also predicted attacks at the ward level (an administrative unit below district) in the two study districts and three additional neighbouring districts.

This study was carried out in the Olgulului group ranch (OGR) located adjacent to Amboseli National Park in June 2009. The cost of livestock killed by each of these species including lion, hyena (Crocuta crocuta), cheetah (Acynonyx jubatus), leopard (Panthera pardus), olive baboon (Papio cynocephalus), black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas), and African elephant (Loxodonta africana) was analyzed.

Cluster and systematic sampling techniques were used to select a sample of 199 respondents from OGR. Lions were blamed for 40.5{\%} (US{\$} 374,603) of the value of livestock lost to wildlife. The costs of livestock lost to hyenas and lions were not significantly different (q = 0.24, p = 0.968). Although hyenas killed more livestock compared to lions, the economic damage between the two was not significantly different because lions attacked cattle which had high economic value. Conservation of lions will be increasingly difficult if the current levels of predation are not reduced to economically and socially acceptable levels.},

abstract = {Elephant crop raiding is one of the most relevant forms of human-elephant conflict (HEC) in Africa. Northern Botswana holds the largest population of African elephants in the world, and in the eastern Okavango Panhandle, 16,000 people share and compete for resources with more than 11,000 elephants. Hence, it is not surprising this area represents a HEC 'hotspot' in the region. Crop-raiding impacts lead to negative perceptions of elephants by local communities, which can strongly undermine conservation efforts. Therefore, assessing trends in conflict levels is essential to developing successful management strategies. In this context, we investigated the trend in the number of reported raiding incidents as one of the indicators of the level of HEC, and assessed its relationship to trends in human and elephant population size, as well as land-use in the study area. For each of these factors, we considered data spanning historical (since the 1970s) and contemporary (2008-2015) time frames, with the aim of comparing subsequent inferences on the drivers of crop raiding and predictions for the future. We find that the level of reported crop raiding by elephants in the eastern Panhandle appears to have decreased since 2008, which seems to be related to the reduction in agricultural land allocated to people in recent years, more than with human and elephant population size. We show that inferences regarding the drivers of HEC and predictions for the future are dependent on the time span of the data used. Although our study represents a first step in developing a HEC baseline in the eastern Panhandle, it highlights the need for additional multi-scale analyses that consider progress in conservation conflict to better understand and predict drivers of HEC in the region.},

abstract = {Protected areas are an important tool for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. But how well do these areas withstand pressure from human activity in surrounding landscapes? Veldhuis et al. studied long-term data from the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem in East Africa. Human activities at boundary regions cause animals to concentrate in the core of the protected area, which eventually reduces soil carbon storage and nitrogen fixation rates and increases vulnerability to extreme droughts. Similar patterns are likely for many, if not all, large protected areas.Science, this issue p. 1424Protected areas provide major benefits for humans in the form of ecosystem services, but landscape degradation by human activity at their edges may compromise their ecological functioning. Using multiple lines of evidence from 40 years of research in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, we find that such edge degradation has effectively “squeezed” wildlife into the core protected area and has altered the ecosystem's dynamics even within this 40,000-square-kilometer ecosystem. This spatial cascade reduced resilience in the core and was mediated by the movement of grazers, which reduced grass fuel and fires, weakened the capacity of soils to sequester nutrients and carbon, and decreased the responsiveness of primary production to rainfall. Similar effects in other protected ecosystems worldwide may require rethinking of natural resource management outside protected areas.},

abstract = {The current extinction crisis is caused primarily by human impacts upon wild populations. Large carnivores are especially sensitive to human activity; because their requirements often conflict with those of local people, predators have been actively persecuted in most regions of the world. In this paper, the impact of people upon predators is analysed by relating local carnivore extinctions to past and projected human population densities. There are strong associations between high human density and the loss of carnivore populations from a region. Interspecific variation in ability to survive at high human densities probably reflects species' ability to adapt to human-modified habitats. However, regional and temporal variation in individual species' sensitivity to human density is more likely to reflect the activities of local people than the phenotypes of local carnivores. Local culture, government policy and international trade all influence human attitudes to predators and, therefore, the impact of people upon carnivore populations. The importance of these factors may mean that extinction risks for carnivores will continue to increase, even though human population growth is projected to deccelerate during the new millennium. This points to an urgent need for techniques to resolve conflicts between people and predators at either the local or landscape level.},

    abstract = { A goal of many research programmes in biology is to extract meaningful insights from large, complex datasets. Researchers in ecology, evolution and behavior (EEB) often grapple with long-term, observational datasets from which they construct models to test causal hypotheses about biological processes. Similarly, epidemiologists analyse large, complex observational datasets to understand the distribution and determinants of human health. A key difference in the analytical workflows for these two distinct areas of biology is the delineation of data analysis tasks and explicit use of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), widely adopted by epidemiologists. Here, we review the most recent causal inference literature and describe an analytical workflow that has direct applications for EEB. We start this commentary by defining four distinct analytical tasks (description, prediction, association, causal inference). The remainder of the text is dedicated to causal inference, specifically focusing on the use of DAGs to inform the modelling strategy. Given the increasing interest in causal inference and misperceptions regarding this task, we seek to facilitate an exchange of ideas between disciplinary silos and provide an analytical framework that is particularly relevant for making causal inference from observational data. }

abstract = {Understanding coexistence between sympatric felines with similar body sizes, such as jaguars Panthera onca and pumas Puma concolor, requires knowledge of the way these predators consume and partition food resources. Yet the importance of livestock predation on jaguar and puma coexistence is poorly known. I investigated food habits and patterns of livestock depredation of jaguar and pumas in the Igua{\c{c}}u National Park (INP) in southern Brazil. From 1997 to 2001, I collected scats opportunistically on trails and roads in INP and visited ranches on the border of INP. I found that jaguars relied mostly on large and medium-sized wild prey species, while pumas concentrated on medium-sized prey species. Livestock was the fifth most frequent prey found in jaguar scats but the most important one in terms of biomass consumed. Jaguar and puma diets differed significantly when all prey items were compared and also when livestock was excluded from the jaguar diet. Jaguar predation on livestock was considerably higher than predation by pumas. However, predation was not substantial relative to availability of livestock, and cattle likely constitute an alternative source of prey for jaguars. Degree of diet overlap between jaguar and puma in INP suggests that coexistence was likely driven by exploitative competition through some degree of food partitioning. My results highlight the importance of more actions toward increasing numbers of large ungulates to preserve the population of jaguars in INR {\textcopyright} 2008 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

Specifically, we investigate whether lions hunt in areas where prey are easy to capture or where prey are locally abundant. 2. We used resource-selection functions (logistic regressions) to measure the location of kills/carcasses with respect to five different habitats: the view-sheds from large rocky outcrops, river confluences, woodland vegetation, erosion embankments and water sources. 3. As expected for a sit-and-wait predator, resting lions spent more time in areas with good cover. On a broad-scale, lions shifted their ranges according to the seasonal movement of prey, but at a finer scale ({\textless} 100 m) lions fed in areas with high prey 'catchability' rather than high prey density. Plains lions selected erosion embankments, view-sheds from rocky outcrops, and access to free water. Woodland lions tended to use erosion embankments, and woody vegetation. 4.

abstract = {Mitigating crop and livestock loss to wildlife and improving compensation distribution are important for conservation efforts in landscapes where people and wildlife co-occur outside protected areas. The lack of rigorously collected spatial data poses a challenge to management efforts to minimize loss and mitigate conflicts. We surveyed 735 households from 347 villages in a 5154 km2 area surrounding Kanha Tiger Reserve in India. We modeled self-reported household crop and livestock loss as a function of agricultural, demographic and environmental factors, and mitigation measures. We also modeled self-reported compensation received by households as a function of demographic factors, conflict type, reporting to authorities, and wildlife species involved. Seventy-three percent of households reported crop loss and 33{\%} livestock loss in the previous year, but less than 8{\%} reported human injury or death. Crop loss was associated with greater number of cropping months per year and proximity to the park. Livestock loss was associated with grazing animals inside the park and proximity to the park. Among mitigation measures only use of protective physical structures were associated with reduced livestock loss. Compensation distribution was more likely for tiger related incidents, and households reporting loss and located in the buffer. Average estimated probability of crop loss was 0.93 and livestock loss was 0.60 for surveyed households. Estimated crop and livestock loss and compensation distribution were higher for households located inside the buffer. Our approach modeled conflict data to aid managers in identifying potential conflict hotspots, influential factors, and spatially maps risk probability of crop and livestock loss. This approach could help focus allocation of conservation efforts and funds directed at conflict prevention and mitigation where high densities of people and wildlife co-occur. {\textcopyright} 2012 Karanth et al.},

Deficiency of wild prey biomass is often described as a driver of such conflicts, but the question "at which level of prey density and biomass do big cats begin to kill livestock?" still remains unanswered. We applied logistic regression to meta-data compiled from recent peer-reviewed scientific publications and show that cattle predation is high when prey biomass is {\textless}812.41±1.26kg/km2, whereas sheep and goat predation is high at {\textless}544.57±1.19kg/km2, regardless of sizes of study areas and species, body masses, and population densities of big cats. Through mapping cases with known prey biomass and case-specific comparison of actual vs. threshold-predicted livestock predation we confirm the reliability of these thresholds in predicting livestock predation by big cats. The map also demonstrates that some protected areas of India, Nepal lowlands, and South Africa contain sufficient prey that makes big cats less likely to kill livestock, but in other sampled areas prey biomass is not high enough and the probabilities of livestock predation are moderate to high. We suggest that these thresholds represent important landmarks for predicting human-felid conflicts, identifying conflict hotspots, and setting priorities for targeted conservation actions. It is essential to maintain and restore wild prey to forestall local extinctions of big cats.},

abstract = {Data for livestock depredation by wild animals were collected in villages outside Serengeti National Park, northern Tanzania. We tested livestock mortality against distance of the villages from the protected area in relation to carnivore species involved, methods used to protect livestock from being depredated and frequency of livestock diseases. The results indicate that distance from the park significantly influenced livestock depredation with the lowest depredation rates in the villages farthest away. Spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) was the most destructive wild animal, followed by small carnivores (including baboons) which were most destructive in the medium and far away villages. Methods used to protect livestock from being depredated differed significantly based on the distance from the protected area. Wild animals cause a significant economic loss to households; however, livestock diseases were the main cause of livestock loss in the study area. The highest frequencies of deaths due to diseases were experienced in villages located closest to the protected area. We recommend that all conservation stakeholders support efforts of local communities to improve their enclosures, and develop education programs to improve their livestock husbandry skills. We also recommend that veterinary units be staffed with well-trained personnel, adequate facilities and substantial operational budgets to enable them to adequately function. Also, not only villagers near protected areas, but also any residents, should be helped by veterinary units. Lastly, we recommend an integrated study on livestock and wildlife diseases and their impact on household economies of the local communities. Keywords:},

We examined the extent and patterns of livestock depredation, the financial impacts of livestock losses and determinants of livestock depredation by large carnivores in the Tarangire ecosystem of northern Tanzania. Of 300 households surveyed, 74.7{\%} reported losses of 1906 livestock to wild predators over 1.5 years, which represents an annual loss rate of 1.4{\%} of their total herd. Spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) accounted for 70{\%} of the total livestock loss, followed by leopard (Panthera pardus) (12{\%}), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) (8{\%}), lion (Panthera leo) (7{\%}) and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) (3{\%}). This loss equated to a total financial loss of US{\$}141,847 amounting to approximately US{\$}633/household/year. Depredation frequency by all carnivore species increased significantly with increasing number of livestock owned, respondent's residency time, distance from the park boundary and declined significantly with increasing education, number of herders and improved fortified boma for cattle. Livestock depredation peaked during the wet season linked to seasonal migration of wild prey. Our study suggests that improving formal and conservation awareness education, boma fortification as well as improving herding practices could help mitigate the human–carnivore conflict.},

abstract = {Lion depredations on livestock are largely responsible for their conflicts with humans and for the historic collapse of their geographic range. Understanding of patterns associated with such predation can be used to mitigate its effects and promote more stable coexistence of lions and humans. We analyzed attacks on livestock over a four-years period on two neighboring arid-land ranches adjoining Tsavo East National Park, Kenya. A total of 312 attacks claiming 433 head of stock were examined. Lions were responsible for 85.9{\%} of the attacks; hyenas and cheetahs were the other predators responsible. Lions and hyenas attacked mainly cattle and did so at night, whereas cheetahs almost exclusively took smaller sheep and goats. There was no temporal autocorrelation of daily losses, suggesting that the attacks are independent events. Both number of attacks and number of stock killed showed significant seasonal differences, and their monthly totals correlated positively with precipitation. Intensified predation in the wet season differs from patterns of lion predation elsewhere but reinforces the pattern that large carnivores take more livestock when native prey are most difficult to find and kill. On average, wildlife attacks claimed 2.4{\%} of range stock annually, and livestock represented ca. 5.8{\%} of the diet of ranch lions. This predation represented 2.6{\%} of the herd's estimated economic value, and cost the ranch {\$}8749 per annum.

abstract = {Human–carnivore conflict (HCC) represents one of the greatest threats to rural livelihoods and the persistence of large carnivores. The application of aversive conditioning, the association of unpleasant stimuli with the occurrence of unwanted behaviors, to mitigate HCC has achieved mixed results within and across species, making a better understanding of the factors driving intervention success critical to inform management practices. We explored the degree to which the chasing of African lions (Panthera leo) out of no tolerance zones conditions lion behavior to reduce their rate of return into community lands or rate of repeated livestock killing, providing evidence-based understanding of program outcomes. We used data from 15 global positioning system (GPS)-collared lions adjacent to Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, with each lion receiving 0–17 conditioning treatments, and analyzed the data using recurrent event survival analysis and logistic regression. Chases were most successful (i.e., lion pushed out of the no tolerance zone by sunrise of the following day) in the dry season (i.e., when wild prey were more predictable), in areas closer to the park, and for individuals from smaller and more stable prides (i.e., had not lost a pride male within six months). Adult females and subadult males were more likely than adult males to reenter community lands, and subadult males were most likely to repeatedly depredate livestock. While livestock depredation has decreased since program initiation, the individuals in this study were overall not less likely to enter community lands or depredate livestock in response to chases when chases were considered isolated events. Rather, it was the consistency of deterrence events that proved most important in reducing livestock depredations, likely because of a stronger reinforcement between the undesired behavior and the negative stimulus. However, lions that had previously habitually killed livestock had greater depredation rates even after several conditioning treatments. Aversive conditioning holds promise in the management of carnivores that depredate livestock, but intervention must be consistent, ideally early in the development of problem behaviors, to maximize intervention effectiveness. Methods that separate wildlife from people (i.e., fencing, livestock enclosure fortification), in combination with aversive conditioning, may be needed to provide a sustainable, long-term solution.},

abstract = {As the sustainability of agricultural citizen science projects depends on volunteer farmers who contribute their time, energy and skills, understanding their motivation is important to attract and retain participants in citizen science projects. The objectives of this study were to assess 1) farmers' motivations to participate as citizen scientists and 2) farmers' mobile telephone usage. Building on motivational factors identified from previous citizen science studies, a questionnaire based methodology was developed which allowed the analysis of motivational factors and their relation to farmers' characteristics. The questionnaire was applied in three communities of farmers, in countries from different continents, participating as citizen scientists. We used statistical tests to compare motivational factors within and among the three countries. In addition, the relations between motivational factors and farmers characteristics were assessed. Lastly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to group farmers based on their motivations. Although there was an overlap between the types of motivations, for Indian farmers a collectivistic type of motivation (i.e., contribute to scientific research) was more important than egoistic and altruistic motivations. For Ethiopian and Honduran farmers an egoistic intrinsic type of motivation (i.e., interest in sharing information) was most important. While fun has appeared to be an important egoistic intrinsic factor to participate in other citizen science projects, the smallholder farmers involved in this research valued 'passing free time' the lowest. Two major groups of farmers were distinguished: one motivated by sharing information (egoistic intrinsic), helping (altruism) and contribute to scientific research (collectivistic) and one motivated by egoistic extrinsic factors (expectation, expert interaction and community interaction). Country and education level were the two most important farmers' characteristics that explain around 20{\%} of the variation in farmers motivations. For educated farmers, contributing to scientific research was a more important motivation to participate as citizen scientists compared to less educated farmers. We conclude that motivations to participate in citizen science are different for smallholders in agriculture compared to other sectors. Citizen science does have high potential, but easy to use mechanisms are needed. Moreover, gamification may increase the egoistic intrinsic motivation of farmers.},

However, the economic value of these losses, and therefore the levels of compensation required has never been calculated. Between January 1993 and June 1996 in a 33-km2 area of Gokwe communal land bordering the Sengwa Wildlife Research Area, 241 livestock were killed by wild carnivores. Baboons (Papio ursinus Kerr), lions (Panthera leo Linnaeus) and leopards (P. pardus Linnaeus) were the most serious predators, contributing 52{\%}, 34{\%} and 12{\%} of kills, respectively. Baboons only killed young goats (Capra hircus Linnaeus) and sheep (Ovis aries Linnaeus) by day, while lions and leopards jumped into fortified kraals at night and killed cattle (Bos indicus Linnaeus), donkeys (Equus asinus Linnaeus) and smallstock. In 1995, predators killed 5{\%} of livestock holdings, double that recorded by other African studies. The annual total value of losses depended upon the degree of lion predation on the most valuable species, cattle and donkeys. The average annual loss per livestock-owning household was US{\$}13, or 12{\%} of each household's net annual income. Losses could be reduced by improving kraal defences against lion and leopard predation in the dry season, when attacks were most common.},

abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) is the second most commonly grown crop worldwide and number one staple food in Africa where it accounts for more than 50{\%} of the energy requirements. However, despite its widespread cultivation and the significance of maize information in Africa, maize crop maps and yield forecasts are hardly available. Yet, systematic area, spatial distribution, and maize yield estimates are important in understanding and addressing food security in Africa. Objective monitoring of maize yield statisics in a systematic way is possible with remotely sensed data. However, absence of maize yield forecasts using remote sensing in Africa has been attributed to the cost of acquiring satellite imagery and the heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes. The recent advances in sensors technology and availability of free high-resolution (spatial and temporal) multispectral satellite images afford an opportunity to forecast maize yield as well as mapping its spatial distribution in near real-time basis. This review gives an overview of maize yield estimation using remotely sensed information and its potential application in a fragmented and highly granular agricultural landscapes in Africa, including inherent challenges and research needs. The review was motivated by challenges faced by researchers and national agricultural statistical services agents when forecasting maize yield using conventional ground-based survey methods. These problems include, but are not limited to, restricted accuracy, and cost and time spent resulting in missed opportunities in food security early warning systems and proper developmental interventions. We conclude that by picking multispectral sensors with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, as well as appropriate classification techniques and accurate ground-truthing data, remote sensing can be a practical option for estimating maize grain yield and its spatio-temporal dynamics in heterogeneous African agricultural landscapes for designing appropriate developmental interventions and technological out scaling.},

In this paper, we studied the potential impact of the addition of new spectral bands in the red edge region in future Landsat satellites on agroecosystem canopy green leaf area index (LAI) retrieval. The test data were simulated from SPARC '03 field campaign HyMap hyperspectral data. Three retrieval approaches were tested: empirical regression based on vegetation index, physical model-based look-up-table (LUT) inversion, and machine learning. The results of all three approaches showed that a potential new spectral band located between the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) red and NIR bands slightly improved the agroecosystem green LAI retrieval accuracy (R2 of 0.787 vs. 0.810 for vegetation index approach, 0.806 vs. 0.828 for LUT inversion approach, and 0.925 vs. 0.933 for machine learning approach). The results of this work are consistent with the conclusions from previous research on the value of Sentinel-2 red edge bands for agricultural green LAI retrieval.},

Despite this, relatively little work has been done to date on the drivers of human-primate conflict, especially compared to other conflict-causing taxa such as large carnivores. However, the drivers of conflict are often very similar across species, so conflict researchers can learn important lessons from work conducted on other taxa. This paper discusses 8 key factors which are likely to affect how hostile people are towards wildlife and any damage they cause-6 of these are common to both carnivores and primates, while one is much more applicable to carnivores and the other is specific to primates. These conflict drivers involve numerous social and cultural factors, and highlight the importance of truly understanding the local drivers of conflict in order to develop effective mitigation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 S.

Besides, modern remote sensing methodologies to obtain these predictions represent important steps towards attaining the goals of precision agriculture for the 21st century. Digital data from satellite images analyzed jointly with crop modelling parameters provide information that enables crop yield estimation. The objective of this study was the estimation of yield and total volume of maize production using Spot-5 satellite images and empirical models. These models expressed a) yield (Y) as a function of LAI, and b) yield as a function of NDVI. To determine the efficiency degree of the calculated predictions at the flowering stage of the crop, yield sampling was done at the physiological maturity stage in pilot plots. Regarding yield prediction in the flowering stage, the models Y = f (LAI) reported a value of 5.96 ton.ha-1 and the model Y = f (NDVI) a value of 5.04 ton.ha-1 was obtained. These data represent 114{\%} and 97{\%} respectively of the true yield recorded on the field. The models are specific to the maize crop and the cultivated plots location, and that the forecasts can be acceptably accurate provided the sown areas are precisely determined.},

abstract = {For thirty years, simple crop water balance models have been used by the early warning community to monitor agricultural drought. These models estimate and accumulate actual crop evapotranspiration, evaluating environmental conditions based on crop water requirements. Unlike seasonal rainfall totals, these models take into account the phenology of the crop, emphasizing conditions during the peak grain filling phase of crop growth. In this paper we describe an analogous metric of crop performance based on time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery. A special temporal filter is used to screen for cloud contamination. Regional NDVI time series are then composited for cultivated areas, and adjusted temporally according to the timing of the rainy season. This adjustment standardizes the NDVI response vis-{\`{a}}-vis the expected phenological response of maize. A national time series index is then created by taking the cropped-area weighted average of the regional series. This national time series provides an effective summary of vegetation response in agricultural areas, and allows for the identification of NDVI green-up during grain filling. Onset-adjusted NDVI values following the grain filling period are well correlated with U.S. Department of Agriculture production figures, possess desirable linear characteristics, and perform better than more common indices such as maximum seasonal NDVI or seasonally averaged NDVI. Thus, just as appropriately calibrated crop water balance models can provide more information than seasonal rainfall totals, the appropriate agro-phenological filtering of NDVI can improve the utility and accuracy of space-based agricultural monitoring.},

abstract = {Remote sensing offers a low-cost method for developing spatially continuous crop production statistics across large areas and through time. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to characterize the production of individual smallholder farms, given that the land-holding size in most areas of South Asia ({\textless}2 ha) is smaller than the spatial resolution of most freely available satellite imagery, like Landsat and MODIS. In addition, existing methods to map yield require field-level data to develop and parameterize predictive algorithms that translate satellite vegetation indices to yield, yet these data are costly or difficult to obtain in many smallholder systems. To overcome these challenges, this study explores two issues. First, we employ new high spatial (2 m) and temporal (bi-weekly) resolution micro-satellite SkySat data to map sowing dates and yields of smallholder wheat fields in Bihar, India in the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 growing seasons. Second, we compare how well we predict sowing date and yield when using ground data, like crop cuts and self-reports, versus using crop models, which require no on-the-ground data, to develop and parameterize prediction models. Overall, sow dates were predicted well (R2 = 0.41 in 2014-2015 and R2 = 0.62 in 2015-2016), particularly when using models that were parameterized using self-report sow dates collected close to the time of planting and when using imagery that spanned the entire growing season. We were also able to map yields fairly well (R2 = 0.27 in 2014-2015 and R2 = 0.33 in 2015-2016), with crop cut parameterized models resulting in the highest accuracies. While less accurate, we were able to capture the large range in sow dates and yields across farms when using models parameterized with crop model data and these estimates were able to detect known relationships between management factors (e.g., sow date, fertilizer, and irrigation) and yield. While these results are specific to our study site in India, it is likely that the methods employed and the lessons learned are applicable to smallholder systems more generally across the globe. This is of particular interest given that similar high spatio-temporal resolution micro-satellite data will become increasingly available in the coming years.},

Little is known about why preferences vary greatly and how this affects support for management actions. This paper explores preferences for a range of wildlife species among a sample of the rural population adjacent to Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. We also examine the degree of acceptance for alternative management interventions when potentially dangerous animals pose different levels of problems to human beings, and the extent to which these attitudes are related to species preferences. Gender has a significant effect on species preferences. Men like most species better than women. Age has no significant effect, but level of education affects preference level for some species. Species preferences have a positive effect on support for management intervention when dangerous animals cause small or moderate problems to humans, i.e. there is a higher degree of acceptance of problems caused by animals that are well liked. In situations where human life is threatened, species preferences have no effect on preferred management actions. Appreciation of animals is a combination of functional, consumptive and cultural dimensions, and there is no simple link between species preferences and attitudes toward management actions. The local context and concrete experience with wildlife encounters is more important for shaping normative beliefs like attitudes towards management actions than global wildlife attitudes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer.},

abstract = {Crop and livestock losses to wildlife are a concern for people neighboring many protected areas (PAs) and can generate opposition to conservation. Examining patterns of conflict and associated tolerance is important to devise policies to reduce conflict impacts on people and wildlife. We surveyed 398 households from 178 villages within 10 km of Ranthambore, Kanha, and Nagarahole parks in India. We compared different attitudes toward wildlife, and presented hypothetical response scenarios, including killing the problem animal(s). Eighty percent of households reported crop losses to wildlife and 13 {\%} livestock losses. Higher crop loss was associated with more cropping months per year, greater crop variety, and more harvest seasons per year but did not vary with proximity to the PA, suggesting that PAs are not necessarily "sources" for crop raiders. By contrast, complaints of "depredating carnivores" were associated with people-grazing animals and collecting resources from PAs. Many households (83 {\%}) engaged in mitigation efforts. We found that only fencing and guard animals reduce crop losses, and no efforts to lower livestock losses. Contrary to our expectations, carnivores were not viewed with more hostility than crop-raiding wildlife. Households reported greater inclination to kill herbivores destroying crops or carnivores harming people, but not carnivores preying on livestock. Our model estimated crop loss was 82 {\%} across surveyed households (highest in Kanha), while the livestock loss experienced was 27 {\%} (highest in Ranthambore). Our comparative study provides insights into factors associated with conflict loss and tolerance, and aids in improving ongoing conservation and compensation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Using detailed data on livestock predation in the Maasai steppe landscape in Northern Tanzania, I investigated how prey preference, location and timing of livestock attacks contributed to the vulnerability of lions, leopards and spotted hyenas to retaliatory killing. Lions mostly preyed upon adult cattle and donkeys. In contrast, hyenas and leopards primarily killed small stock (goat, sheep and calves) and dogs. Hyenas and leopards mostly attacked livestock at night, whereas lions often attacked grazing livestock during the daytime. These behaviors made lions the most vulnerable to direct retaliatory killing, although some villages specifically targeted hyenas with poison, and the cultural traditions of pastoralists also exacerbate the retaliatory killing of lions. I highlight the complex interactions of social (human) and ecological dimensions of livestock predation and retaliation against predators.

abstract = {Most large mammalian carnivores are in global decline, largely due to their involvement in livestock depredation. Research that advances our understanding of predator-livestock interactions is crucial to conflict mitigation and carnivore conservation. Here we investigated the influence of environmental and socio-ecological factors on livestock depredation by carnivores in pastoral villages adjacent to the Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya during a 14-month period. We attempted to identify factors associated with temporal and spatial variation in depredation rates, incorporating data on a closely monitored spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) population known to be involved in depredation events. Spotted hyenas, leopards (Panthera pardus) and lions (Panthera leo) were responsible for 53{\%}, 32{\%}, and 15{\%} of attacks on livestock, respectively. Monthly depredation frequency was correlated positively with rainfall and negatively with natural prey abundance. Radio-telemetry revealed that hyenas defending a group territory within the Reserve spent more time outside the Reserve during months when hyena attacks on livestock were most frequent. Results of logistic regression models, which indicated spotted hyenas were most likely to attack large villages, were supported by behavioral observations of hyenas near villages. Leopards however, selected villages that were spatially isolated from other villages. Hyenas were more likely to attack livestock enclosures constructed of local bush material than those of more sturdy "pole" timber, but use of pole material more than doubled the probability of leopard attack. Selection of fence type should therefore depend on the size and relative isolation of villages. Overall, improved fences, more watch dogs, and high levels of human activity were not associated with lower livestock losses to predators. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this study we assessed the spatial and temporal patterns and socioeconomic correlates of perceived conflict with lions, leopards, hyenas, cheetahs, and wild dogs in the Ngorongoro Highlands and Tarangire Manyara Ecosystem of Northern Tanzania using structured interviews (n = 356). Conflict with large carnivores was mainly prevalent during the wet season, and was spatially highly heterogeneous. Hyenas were the predominant conflict species, followed by leopards. Employing species-specific generalized linear mixed effects models, we assessed spatial, psychological, socio-economic and demographic correlates of perceived conflict. Interestingly, we found few consistencies among correlates for reported conflict frequency. Ethnicity, gender, age, education, fear of large carnivore species, and education had mixed effects on perceived conflict frequency while livestock ownership and relative wealth were negligible in explaining reported conflict frequency. These results suggest that education, psychological and demographic attributes were more influential (though dependent on species and landscape) in wildlife conflict perceptions than economic considerations. Although effective mitigation methods were generally available, they were rarely employed. We suggest that mitigation strategies that address local needs be made more accessible, and that conservation education programs particularly target conflict hotspot areas.},

abstract = {Livestock depredation frequently results in retaliatory killing of carnivores by people. An understanding of the ecological and sociological factors that precipitate this conflict is essential to mitigation. We investigated the seasonality of lion (Panthera leo) depredation incidents in relation to cattle (Bos primigenius) herding patterns in Tsholotsho Communal Land and Ngamo Forest adjacent to Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Cattle from 14 villages along the protected area (PA) boundaries were fitted with GPS data loggers (2010-2012), and depredation incidents systematically recorded (2008-2012). More cattle were killed by lions during the wet season (October to May) than during the dry months (June to September). In the wetter months, corresponding to the growing season and the need to protect crops, cattle were herded further from their home enclosures, closer to PA boundaries and into more wooded habitats. By contrast, cattle remained closer to home, further from PAs and were left to graze in fallow fields close to villages in the dry months. Seasonal use of wooded areas distant to villages and close to PA boundaries during the growing season increases vulnerability of cattle to lion depredation. In the dry months, cattle grazing close to villages benefit from the close proximity of people, resulting in a lower incidence of depredation. Approaches to mitigate livestock depredation should focus on improving herd protection during the wet season when cattle graze far from villages. Strategies such as communal herding, more intensive livestock guarding and, where possible, avoidance of heavily wooded habitats close to PAs should be encouraged.},

In East Africa, projects are fortifying bomas to reduce large carnivore conflicts with the specific goal of preventing the indiscriminate killing of lions.

We evaluated fortified bomas by comparing large carnivore attack rates at 84 unprotected bomas and 62 fortified bomas called Living Walls. The latter were 99.9 {\%} successful in preventing nighttime carnivore attacks over 1,790 boma-months. Following Living Wall installation, there were no lion deaths at fortified bomas. Our results demonstrate the importance of predator-proof enclosures as a tool for lion conservation across the continent in areas where they inhabit human–and livestock–dominated landscapes.

abstract = {Short term food security issues require reliable crop forecasting data to identify the population at risk of food insecurity and quantify the anticipated food deficit. The assessment of the current early warning and crop forecasting system which was designed in mid 80's identified a number of deficiencies that have serious impact on the timeliness and reliability of the data. We developed a new method to forecast maize yield across smallholder farmers' fields in Tanzania (Morogoro, Kagera and Tanga districts) by integrating field-based survey with a process-based mechanistic crop simulation model. The method has shown to provide acceptable forecasts (r2 values of 0.94, 0.88 and 0.5 in Tanga, Morogoro and Kagera districts, respectively) 14–77 days prior to crop harvest across the three districts, in spite of wide range of maize growing conditions (final yields ranged from 0.2–5.9 t/ha). This study highlights the possibility of achieving accurate yield forecasts, and scaling up to regional levels for smallholder farming systems, where uncertainties in management conditions and field size are large.},

  abstract  = {Field experiments and simulation models are useful tools for understanding crop yield gaps, but scaling up these approaches to understand entire regions over time has remained a considerable challenge. Satellite data have repeatedly been shown to provide information that, by themselves or in combination with other data and models, can accurately measure crop yields in farmers' fields. The resulting yield maps provide a unique opportunity to overcome both spatial and temporal scaling challenges and thus improve understanding of crop yield gaps. This review discusses the use of remote sensing to measure the magnitude and causes of yield gaps. Examples from previous work demonstrate the utility of remote sensing, but many areas of possible application remain unexplored. Two simple yet useful approaches are presented that measure the persistence of yield differences between fields, which in combination with maps of average yields can be used to direct further study of specific factors. Whereas the use of remote sensing may have historically been restricted by the cost and availability of fine resolution data, this impediment is rapidly receding. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Grain yield, ear and kernel attributes can assist to understand the performance of maize plant under different environmental conditions and can be used in the variety development process to address farmer's preferences. These parameters are however still laborious and expensive to measure. Results: A low-cost ear digital imaging method was developed that provides estimates of ear and kernel attributes i.e., ear number and size, kernel number and size as well as kernel weight from photos of ears harvested from field trial plots. The image processing method uses a script that runs in a batch mode on ImageJ; an open source software. Kernel weight was estimated using the total kernel number derived from the number of kernels visible on the image and the average kernel size. Data showed a good agreement in terms of accuracy and precision between ground truth measurements and data generated through image processing. Broad-sense heritability of the estimated parameters was in the range or higher than that for measured grain weight. Limitation of the method for kernel weight estimation is discussed. Conclusion: The method developed in this work provides an opportunity to significantly reduce the cost of selection in the breeding process, especially for resource constrained crop improvement programs and can be used to learn more about the genetic bases of grain yield determinants.},

abstract = {Agricultural development accelerates the loss of habitat for many wildlife species and brings humans and animals in close proximity, resulting in increased human-wildlife conflict. In Africa, such conflicts contribute to carnivore population declines in the form of human retaliation for livestock depredation. However, little knowledge exists about when and where carnivores attack livestock. Given this need, our objectives were to (1) understand the spatial and temporal variation of human-carnivore conflict and (2) identify conflict-prone areas. We addressed these objectives in 18 Tanzanian villages of the Maasai Steppe using livestock depredation data on lions (Panthera leo), spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) and leopards (Panthera pardus) from 2004 to 2007. Over the 4-year period, 1,042 carnivore attacks occurred on livestock, with {\textgreater}50{\%} due to hyenas; shoats (goats and sheep) were the most commonly depredated livestock. Livestock depredation was unevenly distributed across villages. About 39{\%} of all recorded attacks occurred in Selela, followed by Emboreet (16{\%}), and Loiborsoit (11{\%}), while Esilalei, Oltukai, and Engaruka all had {\textgreater}5{\%} of all attacks. Villages with {\textless}1{\%} of all attacks on livestock included Losirwa, Terat, Naiti, and Minjingu. Spotted hyenas attacked livestock more during the night and when livestock were in bomas (enclosures where livestock is kept, especially at night), while lions and leopards depredated at similar rates by time of day and location. Livestock depredation was highest during the wet season. Carnivore attacks on livestock could be reduced both by avoiding wildlife migration and dispersal areas during the wet season and by building stronger bomas. Because large carnivore populations are declining, our findings identify possible alternatives to reduce human-carnivore conflicts, thus, facilitating large carnivore conservation efforts in landscapes where large carnivores and livestock co-exist.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in remote sensing, one of the major constraints that still remains is collecting the ground data needed to calibrate and validate remote sensing algorithms at large spatial and temporal scales. This is particularly challenging when mapping continuous variables such as yield, where calibration data often do not exist at the field-scale and are difficult to obtain through visual interpretation of high-resolution imagery. While crop cut estimates of crop yield are widely used to calibrate satellite yield estimation models, these data are time and cost intensive to collect. In this study, we examine the ability of self-reported yield estimates, which are much faster and easier to collect at large scales, to train satellite yield estimation models. We assess the accuracy of self-reported yield data and identify whether it is possible to increase self-reported accuracy by providing more information to farmers about the study design and potential benefits. Our results showed that farmers' self-reported crop yields were not accurate, and that self-reported crop yields led to inaccurate satellite yield estimation models when used for calibration. We also found that providing more information to farmers about the study design and benefits of satellite yield estimation did not improve self-reported accuracy. These results suggest that even though self-reported yield estimates may be a faster and lower cost way to collect field-level yield estimates, they likely are not an adequate data source to train satellite yield prediction models and should be used with caution.},

Based on the close relationship observed between GPP and total chlorophyll content in crops, we applied a model that relies on a product of chlorophyll-related vegetation index and incoming photosynthetically active radiation for remote estimation of GPP in maize. In this study, we tested the performance of this model for maize GPP estimation based on spectral reflectance collected at a close range, 6m above the top of the canopy, over a period of eight years from 2001 through 2008. Fifteen widely used chlorophyll-related vegetation indices were employed for GPP estimation in irrigated and rainfed maize, and accuracy and uncertainties of the models were compared. We also explored the possibility of using a unified algorithm in estimating maize GPP in fields that are different in irrigation, field history and climatic conditions. The results showed that vegetation indices that closely relate to total canopy chlorophyll content and/or green leaf area index were accurate in GPP estimation. Both green and red edge Chlorophyll Indices, MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index as well as Simple Ratio were the best approximations of the widely variable GPP in maize under different crop managements and climatic conditions. They were able to predict daily GPP reaching 30gC/m2/d with RMSE below 2.75gC/m2/d. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

NDVI, soil moisture, surface temperature and rainfall are valuable sources of information for the estimation and prediction of crop conditions. In the present paper, we have considered NDVI, soil moisture, surface temperature and rainfall data of Iowa state, US, for 19 years for crop yield assessment and prediction using piecewise linear regression method with breakpoint. Crop production environment consists of inherent sources of heterogeneity and their non-linear behavior. A non-linear Quasi-Newton multi-variate optimization method is utilized, which reasonably minimizes inconsistency and errors in yield prediction. Minimization of least square loss function has been carried out through iterative convergence using pre-defined empirical equation that provided acceptable lower residual values with predicted values very close to observed ones (R2 = 0.78) for Corn and Soybean crop (R2 = 0.86) for Iowa state. The crop yield prediction model discussed in the present paper will further improve in future with the use of long period dataset.

Active-optical sensor algorithms for predicting corn (Zea mays, L.) yield to direct in-season nitrogen (N) fertilization in corn utilize red NDVI (normalized differential vegetative index). Use of red edge NDVI might improve corn yield prediction at later growth stages when corn leaves cover the inter-row space resulting in “saturation” of red NDVI readings. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of red edge NDVI in two active-optical sensors (GreenSeeker™ and Holland Scientific Crop Circle™) improved corn yield prediction. Nitrogen rate experiments were established at 15 sites in North Dakota (ND). Sensor readings were conducted at V6 and V12 corn. Red NDVI and red edge NDVI were similar in the relationship of readings with yield at V6. At V12, the red edge NDVI was superior to the red NDVI in most comparisons, indicating that it would be most useful in developing late-season N application algorithms.},

abstract = {Index insurance is becoming increasingly popular because of its ability to provide low-cost, relatively easy to implement agricultural insurance for vegetation types whose productivity has been notoriously difficult to measure and to farmers in less-developed nations where traditional crop insurance schemes are not reasonable to implement. This study examines if the remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be an effective basis for index-based crop insurance over a diverse set of locations. To do this the authors compare Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) values tocumulative precipitation, extreme heat, and crop yields for 60 locations across the United States for the years 1982-2003. Quadratic regression equations are used to explore these relationships. The findings suggest that the relationship between NDVI, precipitation, extreme heat, and crop yields is highly variable and dependenton location-specific characteristics. Without site-specific calibration, NDVI should not be widely applied to index-based insurance product design. However, NDVI may still be a useful tool in insurance design under certain circumstances. This may be disappointing to proponents of NDVI as a risk transfer mechanism but the authors believe it important to report negative results as a caveat, and to give researchers and practitioners pause before investing time and money into the proposition. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Conflict between people and large carnivores is an urgent conservation issue world-wide. Understanding the underlying ecological drivers of livestock depredation by large carnivores is greatly needed. We studied the spatial, foraging and behavioural ecology of African lions Panthera leo in the Botswana Makgadikgadi ecosystem. This ecosystem comprises a protected area, characterized by high seasonal fluctuation in wild prey abundance, and adjacent lands, which are used for livestock grazing and characterized by stable livestock abundance, but also a risk of anthropogenic mortality. Makgadikgadi lions preferentially preyed upon migratory wild herbivores when they were present; however, data from GPS (Global Positioning System) radiocollared lions revealed that the majority of the study lions did not follow the migratory herds but remained resident at one or other border of the park and switched to livestock (abundant and readily available), and to a lesser extent resident wild herbivores (relatively scarce), in periods of migratory wild herbivore scarcity. Resident lions' use of space differed between periods of wild prey abundance and scarcity. These changes were likely to increase the frequency of encounter with their primary prey in periods of primary prey abundance and with livestock in periods of primary prey scarcity. The risk of conflict with humans was a major driver of lion ecology in the human-dominated landscape surrounding the protected area. Resident lions generally avoided the close vicinity of cattle-posts. When they used such areas, they avoided temporal overlap with periods that humans were most active and travelled at high speed reducing the time spent in these areas. Synthesis and applications. This study suggests that lions balance the benefits of accessing livestock with the costs associated with livestock raiding. Hence, reduction in livestock availability through effective livestock husbandry in periods of wild prey scarcity should lead to reduced conflict. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {In Africa's pastoral conservation landscapes, apex predators frequently kill livestock. Retaliatory persecution such as poisoning threatens predators, but also non-target biota. Several factors influence conflict severity, including livestock husbandry, overlap in seasonal habitat use, and the degree to which livestock perceive and are able to respond to a landscape of fear. We investigated these factors by GPS-tracking 42 Tswana beef cattle (Bos taurus) from 29 herds in 2017 and six lions (Panthera leo) from different prides (May 2016–Dec. 2017) in the northern Okavango Delta, Botswana, where cattle depredation significantly impacts the livelihoods of rural agro-pastoralists. Cattle exhibited seasonal habitat selection patterns similar to wild ungulates in the region. They preferred woodland habitats, with more digestible grasses, during the wet season. During the dry season, they preferred wetland habitats with reliable forage and water availability. Cattle also preferred areas close to human settlements, but the necessity to forage in wetlands during the dry season exposed them to significant depredation risk, especially {\textgreater}4 km from settlements. Lions killed most cattle in wetlands during the late dry season but the intensity of recent lion presence (previous 14 days) only had a weak negative effect on cattle habitat selection patterns. Cattle used rangelands according to nutritional requirements, irrelevant of the associated predation risk, suggesting that socio-ecologically acceptable conflict solutions cannot rely on the exclusion of livestock from seasonal wetlands. Curbing depredation by lions will best be achieved by a combination of resource- and predation-cognisant seasonal herding strategies with adequate livestock protection. Understanding the ecological constraints that intensify conflict is pertinent to any livestock production landscape with predator presence. It is also a central prerequisite for future land use planning and devolution of legal, controlled resource access rights through policy. Coexistence strategies must account for the strong reliance of people, their livestock, and wildlife on shared key resources. This is particularly important in large trans-frontier conservation areas where the successful merging of biodiversity conservation and rural development is a strategic goal. Omission will foster resentment and resistance to coexistence with apex predators, particularly if livestock productivity and human livelihoods are negatively affected.},

abstract = {Fortified kraals are predator-proof enclosures designed to protect livestock at night. Globally, they show great promise in reducing depredation by carnivores, thus promoting co-existence with people. Their efficacy depends on effectiveness, durability, regular use, owner satisfaction, cost-efficiency, and design. We monitored 32 fortified kraals for 18 months in a high conflict area in northern Botswana (n = 427 kraal months) where lions (Panthera leo) frequently kill cattle. Monthly kraal use was 60{\%} and was significantly influenced by kraal type, age, and shape. When used and maintained, kraals stopped livestock depredation. Due to poor maintenance, however, kraal age had a significant, negative influence on kraal use and effectiveness, compromising sustainability and cost-effectiveness. Fortified kraals built by a non-governmental organisation cost US{\$}1322.36 per unit (n = 20) and mitigated a mean annual loss of {\$}187.32. This suggests cost-recuperation after 7.0 years, or 2.3 times longer than observed kraal lifetime. Conversely, owner-built replicates cost {\$}579.90 per unit (n = 4), recuperating investment after 3.1 years. Owner satisfaction was significantly higher for fortified kraals when compared with traditional kraals. However, owners of fortified kraals did not kraal their cattle more frequently than owners of traditional kraals. Regionally, the mean annual kraaling rate for 29 GPS-monitored cattle herds (n = 3360 nights) was 40{\%}, leaving cattle vulnerable to depredation, and highlighting the importance of promoting vigilant herding together with kraaling to prevent losses. This combination could reduce regional livestock losses by 80{\%}, or {\textgreater}{\$}38,000 annually, however, kraal fortification alone does not provide a blanket solution to carnivore conflicts in Africa's agro-pastoral landscapes.},

abstract = {Cloud cover impedes optical satellite remote sensing instruments from obtaining clear views of the Earth's surface. Meanwhile, agriculture is a highly dynamic process, with significant changes in crop biomass and condition often occurring within roughly a week. The Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Initiative represents international efforts to improve the satellite-based monitoring of agricultural processes at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Within this context, it is necessary to understand how cloud cover impacts the probability of securing reasonably clear views of croplands using passive optical Earth observations as the agricultural growing season progresses. To this end, we employ 10-13. years of twice daily 0.05° MODIS Terra (AM) and Aqua (PM) surface reflectance quality assessment cloud flags to investigate diurnal, geographical, and seasonal (early, mid, late, and non-agricultural growing season) characteristics of cloud cover presence frequency and pervasiveness (amount) over global agricultural areas. To provide insight into the ability of hypothetical missions with two modeled revisit frequencies (f= 2, 4. days) to return reasonably clear views at a rate sufficient to track changes in crop biomass and condition, we show the percentage of 8. day compositing periods throughout the agricultural growing season for which a given clarity requirement (at least 70{\%}, 80{\%}, 90{\%}, or 100{\%} cloud-free) could be met.This research shows that the early and mid-agricultural growing season, which are important periods for crop type area identification and crop yield forecasting, are characterized by both frequent and pervasive cloud extent. Many important agricultural areas during this and other portions of the agricultural growing season are so persistently and pervasively occluded by clouds that less than half of their 8. day composites would be even 70{\%} clear, suggesting that in these areas/time periods, optical, polar-orbiting imaging is not likely to be a viable option for operational monitoring and alternatives (e.g. microwave synthetic aperture radar, SAR) ought to be considered. Further, for most agricultural areas of the world, regardless of seasonality, morning acquisitions are more likely to return reasonably clear views, an important consideration in the planning of future optical, polar-orbiting Earth observing missions with agricultural monitoring science objectives. These results are an important contribution toward the articulation of Earth observation data requirements for global agricultural monitoring.},

abstract = {Spring migration may facilitate survival and recruitment in mammals by reducing predation risk and increasing access to higher-quality forage. The Yellowstone pronghorn Antilocapra americana population ({\textless}250 animals) retains one of only two pronghorn migrations remaining in the greater Yellowstone region of the western United States. We used 5743 telemetry locations of 44 adult, female pronghorn during June 1999-August 2005 to determine migration patterns, seasonal distributions, and individual fidelity to migratory strategies. Yellowstone pronghorn were partially migratory, with {\textgreater}70{\%} of the pronghorn population migrating 15-50 km to 4 contiguous summering areas and {\textless}30{\%} remaining year-round on the winter range. Most radio-collared pronghorn showed fidelity across years to their migration strategy and summer use area, but approximately 20{\%} migrated in some years, but not others. This behavioral flexibility is consistent with the hypothesis that migration in Yellowstone pronghorn is a conditional strategy and likely contributed to dynamic and rapid changes in the proportion of migrants from 80{\%} to 20{\%} and back to 70{\%} during 1967-2005. All migrant pronghorn traveled 10 km over a topographic bottleneck (Mt. Everts) separating the winter and summer ranges, primarily using grassland-sagebrush pathways through conifer forest. We recommend continued protection of this corridor because increased mortality and a decreasing proportion of migrants may be as important a threat to the persistence of partially migratory populations as habitat fragmentation, especially when local resources for non-migrants are inadequate to sustain the entire population. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Maize production in marginal tropical regions is at great risk due to rainfall variability and climate change. Climate change is set to increase the variability and uncertainty of inter-annual rainfall. Farmers who depend on rainfed maize production for their livelihoods would therefore benefit from improved climate based forecasting of production likelihood. In this study we developed a simple maize production decision support tool for Masvingo by using seasonal climate forecasts and a crop model to forecast maize yields likelihood prior to the season. We follow up on earlier studies carried out in Zimbabwe which show that the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can be used to forecast rainfall and maize yields in Zimbabwe. An ENSO based seasonal climate analysis tool (RAINMAN) was used to produce probabilistic monthly climate forecasts for Masvingo corresponding to the phases of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The climate forecasts were used to run a crop model (AquaCrop) for a variety of scenarios relevant to maize production (monthly rainfall, cultivar selection, planting date, and fertility level). The results of the simulations were similar to those observed by Phillips et al. (1997) and formed the basis for the development of an operational decision support tool. Simulated maize yields varied from 1.2. t/ha to 5.8. t/ha. The simulated yields were higher than expected average yields in a marginal region like Masvingo especially under small holder farming. The work suggested that optimal use of forecasts may lead to improved maize production in Masvingo. The study set a platform for the development of operational climate based maize production decision support tools in Zimbabwe. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Integrating remote sensing data into crop models offers opportunities for improved crop yield estimation. To compare site-specific yield estimation accuracy of a stand-alone crop model with a data-integration approach, a study was conducted in 2016–2017 with nitrogen (N)-fertilized and unfertilized treatments across a heterogeneous 7-ha maize field. For each treatment, yield data were grouped into five classes resulting in 109 spatial zones. In each zone, the Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Maize model was run using the GeoSim plugin within Quantum GIS. In the data integration approach, maize biomass values estimated using satellite imagery at the five (V5) and ten (V10) leaf collar stages were used to optimize the total soil nitrogen concentration (SLNI) and soil fertility factor (SLPF) in CERES-Maize. Without integration, maize yield was simulated with root mean square error (RMSE) of 1264 kg ha−1. Optimization of SLNI improved yield simulations at both V5 and V10. However, better simulations were obtained from optimization at V10 (RMSE 1026 kg ha−1) as compared to V5 (RMSE 1158 kg ha−1). Optimization of SLPF together with SLNI did not further improve the yield simulations. This study shows that integrating remote sensing data into a crop model can improve site-specific maize yield estimations as compared to the stand-alone crop modeling approach.},

The combination of remotely sensed optical and radar datasets presents an opportunity for acquiring crop information at relative spatial resolution and temporal resolution adequately to capture the growth profiles of various crop species. In this paper, we employed Sentinel-1A (S-1) and Sentinel-2A (S-2) data acquired between the end of June and early September 2016, on a semi-arid area in northern Nigeria. A different set of (VV and VH) SAR and optical (SI and SB) images, illustrating crop phenological development stage, were employed as inputs to the two machines learning Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to automatically map maize fields. Significant increases in overall classification were shown when the multi-temporal spectral indices (SI) and spectral band (SB) datasets were added with the different integration of SAR datasets (i.e., VV and VH). The best overall accuracy (OA) for maize (96.93{\%}) was derived by using RF classification algorithms with SI-SB-SAR datasets, although the SI datasets for RF and SB datasets for SVM also produced high overall maize classification accuracies, of 97.04{\%} and 97.44{\%}. The outcomes indicate the robustness of the RF or SVM methods to produce high-resolution maps of maize for subsequent application from agronomists, policy planners, and the government, because such information is lacking in our study area.},

The improved temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution of the European Space Agency (ESA) launched Sentinel-2 A + B twin platform is paving the way to their popularization in precision agriculture. Besides the Sentinel-2 A + B constellation technical features the open-access nature of the information they generate, and the available support software are a significant improvement for agricultural monitoring. This paper was motivated by the challenges faced by researchers and agrarian institutions entering this field; it aims to frame remote sensing principles and Sentinel-2 applications in agriculture. Thus, we reviewed the features and uses of Sentinel-2 in precision agriculture, including abiotic and biotic stress detection, and agricultural management. We also compared the panoply of satellites currently in use for land remote sensing that are relevant for agriculture to the Sentinel-2 A + B constellation features. Contrasted with previous satellite image systems, the Sentinel-2 A + B twin platform has dramatically increased the capabilities for agricultural monitoring and crop management worldwide. Regarding crop stress monitoring, Sentinel-2 capacities for abiotic and biotic stresses detection represent a great step forward in many ways though not without its limitations; therefore, combinations of field data and different remote sensing techniques may still be needed. We conclude that Sentinel-2 has a wide range of useful applications in agriculture, yet still with room for further improvements. Current and future ways that Sentinel-2 can be utilized are also discussed.},

abstract = {Crop-type identification is very important in agricultural regions. Most researchers in this area have focused on exploring the ability of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) sensors to identify crops. This paper uses multi-source (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8) and multi-temporal data to identify crop types. The change detection method was used to analyze spectral and indices information in time series. Significant differences in crop growth status during the growing season were found. Then, three obviously differentiated time features were extracted. Three advanced machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Random Forest, RF) were used to identify the crop types. The results showed that the detection of (Vertical-vertical) VV, (Vertical-horizontal) VH, and Cross Ratio (CR) changes was effective for identifying land cover. Moreover, the red-edge changes were obviously different according to crop growth periods. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 showed different normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes also. By using single remote sensing data to classify crops, Sentinel-2 produced the highest overall accuracy (0.91) and Kappa coefficient (0.89). The combination of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 data provided the best overall accuracy (0.93) and Kappa coefficient (0.91). The RF method had the best performance in terms of identity classification. In addition, the indices feature dominated the classification results. The combination of phenological period information with multi-source remote sensing data can be used to explore a crop area and its status in the growing season. The results of crop classification can be used to analyze the density and distribution of crops. This study can also allow to determine crop growth status, improve crop yield estimation accuracy, and provide a basis for crop management.},

abstract = {Food security will be increasingly challenged by climate change, natural resource degradation, and population growth. Wheat yields, in particular, have already stagnated in many regions and will be further affected by warming temperatures. Despite these challenges, wheat yields can be increased by improving management practices in regions with existing yield gaps. To identify the magnitude and causes of current yield gaps in India, one of the largest wheat producers globally, we produced 30 meter resolution yield maps from 2001 to 2015 across the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), the nation's main wheat belt. Yield maps were derived using a new method that translates satellite vegetation indices to yield estimates using crop model simulations, bypassing the need for ground calibration data. This is one of the first attempts to apply this method to a smallholder agriculture system, where ground calibration data are rarely available. We find that yields can be increased by 11{\%} on average and up to 32{\%} in the eastern IGP by improving management to current best practices within a given district. Additionally, if current best practices from the highest-yielding state of Punjab are implemented in the eastern IGP, yields could increase by almost 110{\%}. Considering the factors that most influence yields, later sow dates and warmer temperatures are most associated with low yields across the IGP. This suggests that strategies to reduce the negative effects of heat stress, like earlier sowing and planting heat-Tolerant wheat varieties, are critical to increasing wheat yields in this globally-important agricultural region.},

  abstract = {Abstract Fencing is one of the most common methods of mitigating human-wildlife conflicts. At the same time, fencing is considered one of the most pressing threats emerging in conservation globally. Although fences act as barriers and can cause population isolation and fragmentation over time, it is difficult to quantitatively predict the consequences fences have for wildlife. Here, we model how fencing designed to mitigate human-elephant conflict (HEC) on the Borderlands between Kenya and Tanzania will affect functional connectivity and movement corridors for African elephants. Specifically, we (a) model functional landscape connectivity integrating natural and anthropogenic factors; (b) predict seasonal movement corridors used by elephants in non-protected areas; and (c) evaluate whether fencing in one area can potentially intensify human-wildlife conflicts elsewhere. We used GPS movement and remote sensing data to develop monthly step-selection functions to model functional connectivity. For future scenarios, we used an ongoing fencing project designed for HEC mitigation within the study area. We modelled movement corridors using least-cost path and circuit theory methods, evaluated their predictive power and quantified connectivity changes resulting from the planned fencing. Our results suggest that fencing will not cause landscape fragmentation and will not change functional landscape connectivity dramatically. However, fencing will lead to a loss of connectivity locally and will increase the potential for HEC in new areas. We estimate that wetlands, important for movement corridors, will be more intensively used by the elephants, which may also cause problems of overgrazing. Seasonal analysis highlights an increasing usage of non-protected lands in the dry season and equal importance of the pinch point wetlands for preserving overall function connectivity. Synthesis and applications. Fencing is a solution to small-scale human-elephant conflict problems but will not solve the issue at a broader scale. Moreover, our results highlight that it may intensify the conflicts and overuse of habitat patches in other areas, thereby negating conservation benefits. If fencing is employed on a broader scale, then it is imperative that corridors are integrated within protected area networks to ensure local connectivity of affected species.},

abstract = {Non-lethal mitigation of crop use by elephants Loxodonta africana is an increasingly important part of protected area management across Africa and Asia. Recently, beehive fences have been suggested as a potential mitigation strategy. We tested the effectiveness of this method in a farming community adjacent to Udzungwa Mountains National Park in southern Tanzania. Over a 5.5-year period (2010-2016) a beehive fence was introduced and subsequently extended along the Park boundary. The probability that one or more farms experienced crop loss from elephants on a given day was reduced in the presence of the fence and was reduced further as the fence was extended. The number of hives occupied by bees along the fence was the best predictor of elephants' visits to farms. Farms closest to the fence experienced a greater likelihood of damage, particularly during the initial period when the fence was shorter. The number of farms affected by elephants declined when the fence was extended. There was a higher probability of damage on farms that were closer to the Park boundary and further from a road. Our mixed results suggest that the shape, length and location of fences need to be carefully planned because changes in a farm's long-term susceptibility to elephant damage vary between individual farms; fences need to be long enough to be effective and ensure that decreasing crop loss frequency is not outweighed by an increasing number of farms damaged per visit.},

abstract = {Crop-raiding by wildlife is a common concern in areas where agriculture plays an important role for sustaining rural livelihoods. Different techniques have been used to prevent crop loss by wildlife. This study examined wildlife crop damage as reported and experienced by people in villages surrounding Serengeti National Park (SNP). The results showed that generally crop production was not the only important economic activity people relied on. We conclude that hunting could be an alternative to crop production. Furthermore, education, employment status, wealth, immigration status and location influenced crop production significantly. Perceptions towards problematic wildlife varied between districts, but small- to medium-sized wildlife were perceived most problematic to crop production. Furthermore, respondents identified climate change factors and inadequate agriculture extension services to affect crop production. The study proposes further development of income-generating activities such as beekeeping and ecotourism as alternatives to crop production. These natural resources-based activities address food insecurity and increase livelihood options. Compensation for extreme cases of crop destruction and improved capacity and delivery of extension services could make agriculture around Serengeti more sustainable. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

We surveyed experts on 63 fenced and 121 unfenced PAs across 23 African countries to assess the advantages and drawbacks of fencing. Where fences exist, they are largely supported and widely viewed as effective at demarcating PA boundaries and mitigating human-wildlife conflicts. However, most fences were insufficiently funded, which limited their ability to contain conflict-prone species like elephants and lions. Fences were also frequently vandalised and caused numerous conflicts with local communities. We documented for the first time the distribution of and support for fencing in PAs across Africa. While fencing is largely limited to Southern Africa and East Africa, support for fencing is greatest in West Africa and is associated with high human and livestock densities, and high threats from bushmeat harvesting, livestock encroachment, and logging.},

The authors note two themes emerged from the review: 'firstly, that no single method works in isolation, but rather that combinations provide the best chance of success; and secondly, that it is of fundamental importance to include those who are most affected by the problem in the solution'. Conflict alleviation is a two sided equation in that both elephant and people are in conflict, and 'the goal is to enable coexistance and sharing of resources on some scale'. Both sides of the equation must be addressed. Effective land use planning and tolerance for elephants can bring about some alleviation, but new stategies need to be developed and constantly revised in addressing the problems associated with crop-raiding elephants. The authors conclude that the key concept of effective alluviation of human-elephant conflict is 'adaptive management'.},

The study aimed to identify crop-raiding wild animals, the prevalence of crop damage, and the conflict resolution mechanism. Data were collected by questionnaire, interview, and direct field observation to estimate the extent of the crop loss and species of an animal involved in crop-raiding. The findings identified Anubis Baboon (Papio anubis), Vervet Monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), and Grivet Monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops) as the major crop pests, followed by Porcupines (Hystrix cristata), Birds and Mongoose (Helogale hirtula). Foraging typically Maize (Zea may) followed by Teff (Eragrostis tef), Enset (Ensete ventricosum), and Barley (Hordeum vulgare). Deforestation, illegal agricultural activities, and farmland distance to the forest were identified as causes of the conflict. In addition, scarecrow, chasing, and permanent guardians have been identified as traditional crop damage prevention techniques of the local people of the area. Therefore, to alleviate the existing impact of crop damage or loss by crop-pest or crop-raiding animals in the area adopting various most suitable approaches along with the awareness and involvement of local farmers would be a critical step.},

@article{Fehlmann2017,
abstract = {Growing human populations are increasingly competing with wildlife for limited resources and this can result in chronic human–wildlife conflict. In the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, chacma baboons Papio ursinus are habitual raiders of urban and rural areas, foraging on a variety of human-derived foods. Raiding behaviour is considered a threat to human health and safety, may result in damage to property, and has adverse welfare and conservation impacts on baboons. To mitigate this conflict, Cape Town municipality employs field rangers with paintball markers that ‘herd' baboons away from the urban edge. While this strategy is successful in reducing the time baboons spend in urban spaces, baboons still raid successfully. Here, we use direct observation and GPS data to investigate how one troop uses the peri-urban space and exploits human-derived foods in urban areas and on farmland. We contrast this behaviour with the individual management strategies adopted by field rangers which we assessed in individual interviews. We find that baboons utilize space (1) where inter-individual variation in field ranger management strategy is highest, (2) that is close to refuges in forested habitat and (3) that is close to the urban edge. Overall, this suggests adaptive space use by the baboons, whereby they minimize distances to refuges and potential food rewards, while exploiting uncertainty in risk variability that arises due to inter-individual differences in ranger management strategy. Together these results highlight the need for ranger consensus to reinforce management efficiency when dealing with a highly adaptive primate.},

The intensity of crop raiding was quantified through the use of random crop quadrants/plots and area estimation techniques in a portion of raided fields. The animal species concerned were documented from observations, footprints and any other marks left behind. Three variables were tested as predictors of damage: human population density, distance from the park boundary and season. In this study, data is presented regarding crop loss in the different seasons of the year, analysis of crop damage variation and animal species involved in crop loss. A diverse assemblage of animals foraged on subsistence crops and analysis of crop damage revealed significant crop depreciation by wildlife.},

Our main objective was to investigate the interactions between humans and vervet monkeys in an agricultural area adjacent to a forest zone. Other studies have reported that farms located within 300 m of a forested boundary probably incur the greatest risk of crop-raiding. Two other factors that may influence susceptibility to vervet crop-raiding were also examined: the types of crops grown and the types of direct preventative measures used. The effect of these two factors on vervet crop-raiding is not straightforward. However, the distance a property is located from the forest edge is an important factor influencing vervet crop-raiding. Surveyed gardens 200 m from the forest edge received significantly less crop-raiding than farms located 100 m or 50 m (P = 0.040, {\textless} $\alpha$ = 0.05).We suggest that the development of nonagricultural activities on land directly adjacent to forested areas may reduce vervet crop-raiding by deterring vervets from travelling greater distances from the forest edge due to increased obstacles or risks.},

Data were collected via a questionnaire survey. Additional information was obtained from the relevant local government offices. Chimpanzees Pan troglodytes, baboons Papio anubis, other monkeys, bush pigs Potamochoeus procus and porcupines Hystrix cristata were reported by farmers to be the major causes of crop losses by wildlife. Of farmers, 73{\%} reported suffering crop damage caused by primates, and 79{\%} considered baboons to be the most destructive of all crop raiding species. Drought, insect pests, poor sowing, plant diseases and accidental fires were other sources of crop losses to farmers, though the risk of crop damage particularly by primates is perceived as the most serious potential cause of losses. Using chimpanzees as a case study, patterns of crop damage across the year are compared with seasonal fluctuations in availability of wild foods. {\textcopyright} Wildlife Biology.},

@article{Wallace2012,
abstract = {Human-wildlife conflict often arises from crop-raiding, and insights regarding which aspects of raiding events determine crop loss are essential when developing and evaluating deterrents. However, because accounts of crop-raiding behaviour are frequently indirect, these parameters are rarely quantified or explicitly linked to crop damage. Using systematic observations of the behaviour of non-human primates on farms in western Uganda, this research identifies number of individuals raiding and duration of raid as the primary parameters determining crop loss. Secondary factors include distance travelled onto farm, age composition of the raiding group, and whether raids are in series. Regression models accounted for greater proportions of variation in crop loss when increasingly crop and species specific. Parameter values varied across primate species, probably reflecting differences in raiding tactics or perceptions of risk, and thereby providing indices of how comfortable primates are on-farm. Median raiding-group sizes were markedly smaller than the typical sizes of social groups. The research suggests that key parameters of raiding events can be used to measure the behavioural impacts of deterrents to raiding. Furthermore, farmers will benefit most from methods that discourage raiding by multiple individuals, reduce the size of raiding groups, or decrease the amount of time primates are on-farm. This study demonstrates the importance of directly relating crop loss to the parameters of raiding events, using systematic observations of the behaviour of multiple primate species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wallace, Hill.},

Here, in a novel approach, predator-specific landscapes of fear are constructed on the basis of behavioral responses of a prey species (vervet monkey; Cercopithecus aethiops), and we show how these can be combined with data on resource distribution to account for the observed variation in intensity of space use. Results from a mixed regressive-spatial regressive analysis demonstrate that ranging behavior can indeed be largely interpreted as an adaptive response to perceived risk of pr{\'{e}}dation by some (but not all) predators and the spatial availability of resources. The theoretical framework behind the model is furthermore such that it can easily be extended to incorporate the effects of additional factors potentially shaping animal range use and thus may be of great value to the study of animal spatial ecology. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Non-lethal mitigation of crop use by elephants Loxodonta africana is an increasingly important part of protected area management across Africa and Asia. Recently, beehive fences have been suggested as a potential mitigation strategy. We tested the effectiveness of this method in a farming community adjacent to Udzungwa Mountains National Park in southern Tanzania. Over a 5.5-year period (2010-2016) a beehive fence was introduced and subsequently extended along the Park boundary. The probability that one or more farms experienced crop loss from elephants on a given day was reduced in the presence of the fence and was reduced further as the fence was extended. The number of hives occupied by bees along the fence was the best predictor of elephants' visits to farms. Farms closest to the fence experienced a greater likelihood of damage, particularly during the initial period when the fence was shorter. The number of farms affected by elephants declined when the fence was extended. There was a higher probability of damage on farms that were closer to the Park boundary and further from a road. Our mixed results suggest that the shape, length and location of fences need to be carefully planned because changes in a farm's long-term susceptibility to elephant damage vary between individual farms; fences need to be long enough to be effective and ensure that decreasing crop loss frequency is not outweighed by an increasing number of farms damaged per visit.},
